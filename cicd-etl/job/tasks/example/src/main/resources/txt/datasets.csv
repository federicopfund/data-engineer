<p> This paper aims to investigate for the first time the role of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) in shaping the future energy policy for Saudi Arabia. It begins with a broad analysis ofthe strategic context for CCS. Itthen reviews CCS developmentin Saudi Arabia, including CCS research activities, sources of CO2 emissions, and the potential for CO2 storage. Finally, it explores the stakeholder attitudes toward the role of CCS in Saudi Arabia, through a survey targeting oil and gas professionals mainly working in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. There is a widespread agreement by the stakeholders surveyed that CCS is one of the priorities for managing carbon emissions, and it holds the potential as a “gamechanger” in Saudi Arabia. Stakeholders believe that “high capital costs” and “technical uncertainty” are primary barriers to CCS demonstration, and they generally do not regard the risks of CCS as particularly significant. Most of the stakeholders agree that the first large scale CCS demonstration project should be supported by Saudi Government subsidy, and that this is the most appropriate incentive for CCS demonstration in Saudi Arabia. There is substantial support for providing the same level of incentive for CCS as for renewables. There is also a common agreement that power generation, oil refining, and gas processing are the most suitable sectors in Saudi Arabia for capturing CO2. Most of the stakeholders favor post-combustion capture technology, and are consistently more enthusiastic about combining CCS with enhanced oil recovery (EOR). </p>";KAPSARC Publications;International Journal, Stakeholder attitudes, EOR, CCS;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2013-02-13T13:22:48+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:54+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-role-of-CO2-capture-and-storage-in-Saudi-Arabias-energy-future_Liu-H_2012.pdf;0;Hengwei Liu, Berenice Garcia Tellez, Tarek Atallah, Murad Barghouty;;;;;;;2013-02-13;2013-02-13;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

between countries, the need to take into account
specific national economic circumstances was
highlighted. Important factors include: the path of

demographic change, cultural norms, energy prices,
urbanisation, geography, and climate. As a significant
part of the profile of a country’s energy intensity is
embodied in its imports and exports of goods, the effect of moving towards metrics that normalise for
the embodied energy and carbon in trade was also
discussed.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop, GDP, gross domestic product, oecd, Energy;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2013-12-06T12:00:24+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:42+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS1301WB01C_energy_productivity_workshop_policy_brief.pdf;0;Tarek Atallah, Patrick Bean, Berenice Garcia-Tellez, Anwar Gasim, Nicholas Howarth;;;;;;;2013-12-06;2013-12-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
energy-systems-modeling-to-support-policy-making;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Energy systems modeling to support policy making;<p><strong>Summary for policymakers</strong></p><p>In October 2013, KAPSARC convened a workshop in Washington, DC attended by some 30 international energy economic modeling and policy experts. Discussions addressed the need to match evolving policy imperatives with new and improved modeling approaches.</p><p>The main needs of energy system models over the past three decades trace a journey from an era in which concerns about security and sufficiency of supply were the dominant themes (1970s and 1980s), through a swing towards liberalizing markets, particularly North American natural gas and electric power (1980s and 1990s), to a growing concern about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions (2000s). In addition, there are now numerous countries with quickly developing economies under central economic controls. Perhaps the future will require models that optimize the energy economies of such countries, developing under a centralized state capitalism model and administered prices.</p><p>As policy imperatives evolved over time, so did the various models and their types, changing their techniques and evolving their data sources. As a result, there is now a plethora of different models that cater to the evolving needs of policy makers, including optimization, equilibrium, and macroeconometric models.</p><p>Successful models to support policy interventions distinguish between: </p><p>- the policy objectives or needs for the degree of intervention necessary, </p><p>-the measures and targets used to influence the decision making environment in the sector or economy, and </p><p>- the actions which address the policy objectives and meet the targets. </p><p>As valuable as these models are in describing various scenarios, policy makers can, nonetheless, benefit from remembering that model outputs are not forecasts so much as descriptions of what would happen if the representation of reality they describe were to play out. Models are always simplifications of reality and there will always be exogenous factors that lead to a difference between “forecasts” and the actual outturn</p>;KAPSARC Publications;policymakers,  KAPSARC Energy Model, KEM, National Energy Modeling System, NEMS,  Market Allocation Model , MARKAL, The Integrated MARKAL EFOM Systems , TIMES, Energy Information Administration , EIA;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2014-02-06T13:22:28+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:41+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1401-WB01B-Energy-Modeling-Workshop-Policy-Brief.pdf;0;KAPSARC;;;;;;;2014-02-06;2014-02-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the-case-for-energy-productivity-its-not-just-semantics;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;The case for energy productivity: It’s not just semantics;<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Ratios that link energy consumption, or its related emissions, to the economic value generated accommodate the differing progress on economic development of nations better than absolute measures. Policymakers are increasingly using indicators such as energy efficiency, intensity, and productivity to address the interrelated issues of economic development, energy security, and environmental sustainability.</p><p>Although setting formal targets in terms of energy intensity has helped to build consensus on several issues, policymakers have an opportunity to enroll even greater public support through the use of energy productivity.</p><p>Energy productivity and energy intensity may be reciprocals that share the same components and policy-relevant attributes. But energy productivity has important advantages—the differences between the two measures go beyond semantics. Productivity has a more positive connotation, is more intuitive, is aligned with efficiency, and portrays grander ambition. From a behavioral economics perspective, these traits can help frame policies that yield more meaningful improvements.</p><p>The mathematical representation of energy intensity makes comparisons of relative change across time and countries more difficult because of something we call the energy intensity illusion—the metric appears to converge towards a mean. Energy productivity’s mathematical representation, on the other hand, avoids this illusion, providing additional insight and making it a more directly relevant measure of a country’s economy, energy, and environmental performance.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;GDP, gross domestic product;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2014-03-06T13:22:27+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:41+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS1402DP01B_case_for_energy_productivity_discussion_paper.pdf;0;Patrick Bean;;;;;;;2014-03-06;2014-03-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lowering-saudi-arabias-fuel-consumption-and-energy-system-costs-without-increasi;;;;;EMEA;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Lowering Saudi Arabia’s fuel consumption and energy system costs without increasing end consumer prices;<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><div>Saudi Arabia aims to reduce the growth of its energy demand. This paper outlines an approach that could help the country to reduce substantively its current fuel consumption and could result in a net economic gain without increasing current end consumer prices and while maintaining positive utility sector net cash flows. Using a new multi-sector equilibrium model developed  by  KAPSARC  (the  KAPSARC  Energy Model or KEM), we estimate the magnitudes of the potential  economic  gains  that  different  policies  </div><div>would generate. </div> <div>Our long term static version of the model reveals that an annual economic gain exceeding 23 billion USD in  2011,  or  almost  5%  of  that  year’s  GDP,  could have  been  achieved  while  the  water  and  power sectors continue to live within their cash flows. Our </div><p>approach—which  introduces  investment  credits  for solar  and  nuclear  and  allows  more  natural  gas consumption in  the  power sector—achieves  almost all the benefit of raising inter-sector transfer prices for  fuels  to  world  market  equivalences,  but  only  </p><div>moderately   increases   current   transfer   prices. Importantly, this gain does not require an increase in consumer prices of electricity or water.</div> <div>The main conclusions of this work are the following:</div>  <ul><li>Our  modeling  shows  it  is  possible  to  solve  the apparent  contradiction  of  inducing  greater efficiencies and lower energy consumption, while preserving current consumer prices.</li></ul><ul><li>All  scenarios  lead  to  substantive  reductions  in fuel  consumption  and  attractive  net  economic gains  when  compared  to  the  baseline  scenario. The  Price-deregulation  scenario,  which  prices fuels at the marginal value, yields the highest net gain, but those gains are broadly matched by the gains achieved with the Investment-credit option.Furthermore,  the  latter  option  maintains  the profitability of the utilities.</li></ul><ul><li>The  net  economic  gain  is  impacted  by  the assumed value of oil saved, which also affects the optimal  equipment  mix,  but  that  gain  is  always positive  irrespective  of  the  chosen  value  of  oil saved.</li></ul><ul><li>In all scenarios, the economic gain for the nation as  a  whole,  as  well  as  for  the  government,  is substantial.  The  petrochemical    and  utilities sectors suffer reduced net revenues relative to the baseline  scenario,  but  those  losses  are  more moderate in the Investment-credit scenarios and would be ameliorated in practice by honoring the terms of existing contracts.</li></ul> <div>Our  approach  is  consistent  with  decentralized decision making, allowing price incentives to guide efficient  investment  decisions,  and  avoids  the supervisory  burden  that  top-down  planning  would impose. Furthermore, it maximizes the societal gain that  can  be  achieved  without  burdening  end consumers with higher prices.</div>;KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2014-03-07T11:46:22+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:41+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS1403DP02C_optimizing_saudi_energy_system_discussion_paper.pdf;0;Walid Matar, Frederic Murphy, Axel Pierru, Bertrand Williams - Rioux;;;;;;;2014-03-07;2014-03-07;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The focus was on government intervention in the micro-economy, including regulation of energy markets, sustainable technologies, case studies quantifying the impact of energy policy implementation, and climate policy.</p><p><strong>Summary for policymakers</strong></p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p>The challenges of energy policy are multiplying, particularly as climate change has become a feature of the discourse around the world. There is no single policy tool that addresses all elements of the energy trilemma – securing affordable, reliable, and environmentally sustainable energy. The resulting collage of often overlapping policies may yield unexpected, and potentially undesirable, results without a proper ex-ante analysis of their interactions.</p><p>Government intervention is ubiquitous in the energy landscape, including taxation, subsidization, and directly regulating market operations among others. These interventions are aimed at:</p><p>Achieving social or political objectives, such as alleviating financial burdens on low-income households or incentivizing growth in a particular economic sector by regulating input prices. </p><p>- Mitigating the effects of externalities, such as by adopting a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system. </p><p>- Reducing the real or perceived risks of market failure. </p><p>- Controlling the presence of market power and inducing competition.</p><p>In some countries, market intervention represents the status quo leading to consideration of policies focused on transition from a centrally planned economy to more competitive markets. But such market deregulation may impact end consumers and the social compact of a nation to the point of precipitating further interventions to restore a politically acceptable balance. </p><p>Policies can achieve their intended outcomes or result in unintended consequences. For example, Independent Systems Operators in the US power market upgraded their optimization technology for clearing day-ahead electricity markets, saving millions of dollars for consumers. By contrast, US biofuel policies ran into unanticipated market conditions – declining demand for gasoline – and had to be reframed to remain viable.</p><p>The application, in a holistic, integrated framework of a range of analytical techniques may lead to better coordination among policy instruments and a better understanding of their interactions in producing policy outcomes. An example of the alternative is the uncoordinated planning and implementation of policies in the EU, which targeted a combination of carbon trading, climate, renewables and power market integration. The resulting undesirable interactions led to a rise in carbon emissions, a fall in carbon prices, which depressed “low carbon” investment, and an increase in the costs of renewable subsidies that distorted incentives to invest in capacity. </p><p>Could policy misalignments be prevented by engaging in better modeling and analysis to understand how different policies might interact? In the increasingly multidimensional policy environment, individual stakeholders that focus on only one aspect of the problem may generate misleading conclusions.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;KEM, micro-economy, energy markets, KAPSARC Energy Model;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2014-10-06T13:22:25+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:39+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1405-WB03A-Energy-Systems-Modeling-Workshop-Brief.pdf;0;Walid Matar, Frederick Murphy, Axel Pierru, Bertrand Williams-Rioux, David Wogan;;;;;;;2014-10-06;2014-10-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It produces and consumes roughly 50% of the world's annual coal demand, while also being the largest importer of coal (accounting for 16% of total coal imports). China is the world's largest oil importer, yet is still the world's fifth largest oil producer. Also, it has the world's most ambitious nuclear program, the world's largest renewable energy industry and one of the fastest growing demands for natural gas. China's appetite for energy is huge and is set to grow substantially over at least the next decade. </p><p>There appear to be two main challenges facing research into China's energy economy:</p><p> - Necessary specialism can narrow scope and undermine opportunities for cross disciplinary synergy; and </p><p>- While data are the foundation stones of any approach, understanding the limitations of Chinese data is one thing, overcoming these limitations another.</p><p> Three non-traditional approaches that may deliver greater insight comprise:</p><p> - Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) formulations.

This can be measured by a country’s energy productivity. Perhaps nowhere else in the world is this issue more salient than in China. China is the world’s largest energy consumer and has led global economic growth in the first part of the twenty-first century. Furthermore, in the interconnected world we live in, decisions in China have global impacts. In periods of some of its fastest growth (from 2002-2005) China experienced declining energy productivity. In 2006, China put in place ambitious energy intensity targets. Combined with policies at the sector and product level, these contributed to China reversing its falling energy productivity. Building on this success, China’s 12th Five Year Plan, extended and deepened these reforms. But within China’s system of provincial and industrial energy intensity targets there is a blind spot which could reduce the potential welfare gain from these plans. Assessing the embodied energy in interprovincial trade reveals these potential gains and provides the information required to encourage regional practices to align better with national objectives. The response from Chinese policymakers to the challenges of building new infrastructure while managing resource and environmental constraints provides a valuable lesson for governments in rapidly developing countries, such as Saudi Arabia. A summary of key lessons from the Chinese experience of managing energy productivity is presented in the conclusion.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;Five Year Plan, FYP, National Reform and Development Commission , NDRC;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2014-10-06T13:22:26+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:39+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1409-DP03A-Managing-Chinas-energy-productivity-potential-what-lessons-for-policy-makers.pdf;0;Nicholas Howarth, Leo Lester, Jin Min, Xia Yan;;;;;;;2014-10-06;2014-10-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

energy-productivity-aligning-global-agendas;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Energy Productivity aligning global agendas;"<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The well-established link between economic growth and energy usage presents a conundrum for policymakers that can be resolved by focusing on energy productivity to promote greater societal welfare. Energy productivity focuses attention on how energy resources can be put to their best use, augmenting scarce energy resources, and how energy efficiency can lift economic growth. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Energy productivity appears to be a poorly understood concept, but it holds the key to one of the greatest reservoirs for increasing wealth and welfare available to the world. It is a concept tied intimately to energy efficiency - the amount of output (e.g. tons of steel or lumens emitted etc.) per unit of energy input. However, at the sector, national, or global level, this efficiency can be measured as energy productivity: the economic output (e.g. GDP or value added) per unit of energy input.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> It can be argued that, over the last 40 years, energy efficiency has provided more energy than virtually any other energy source. Yet, until recently, it has not commonly been thought of as a fuel, and has been overlooked by politicians, businesses, and economic modelers in favor of supply-side expansion. The problem with energy efficiency as an organizing narrative for policymakers is that it is often framed as a way of reducing energy demand. Empirically, energy demand continues to rise outside of recessions, so energy efficiency is seen by some as somehow failing, at least at the national level.

</p>
<p>Using two well-known renewable energy transition
case studies, potential transformations in the
competitive landscape that are typically overlooked
in policy design have been identified.</p>
<p>Germany’s energy transition journey exemplifies the
complexities arising from trying to achieve local
industry development targets and high penetration
targets, simultaneously, within a tight timeframe.
With hindsight, we can say that policy has
overlooked the potential competitive pressures that
could have arisen from global suppliers, inhibiting
the achievement of local goals. Additionally, the
German experience demonstrates how
underestimating future cost reductions in the
supported renewable technology can result in
transmuting a reasonable financial incentive to a profligate one, and consequently causing political
controversy while trying to agree on policy
amendments. Scenario planning and asking ‘what-if’
questions are routes to mitigating the associated
uncertainty. Equivalently, policies can be designed
with flexibility attached to them to adapt for
potential changing market conditions</p>
<p>In the US, regardless of the numerous federal and
state policy instruments that were devised to support
wind energy penetration, the natural gas value chain
continued to improve its competitiveness in both the
production of fuel and conversion to electric power –
the supply cost curve moved downwards, even in the
face of flat or growing demand levels. These
improvements, which were not competitive reactions
to wind industry growth, changed the landscape for
all power generating technologies. We can imagine
that this progress will continue, even assuming
policy driven support for a new technology does not
eat into the market share of the incumbent. It will
therefore take longer than originally imagined by
policy makers for the new entrant to become cost
competitive in its own right. The high reliance of
wind energy development on incentives for more
than 20 years since the introduction of the wind PTC
is an example. However, if the new entrant secures
so great a penetration that demand for the incumbent
begins to decline in absolute terms, the incumbent
will move further down the supply curve to a lower
marginal cost. This additional consequence of
competition will further prolong the need for policy
support for the new entrant.</p>
<p>The scale and duration of financial commitments by
governments are undoubtedly an important aspect of
any policy, and the case studies tell us that policy
suppleness with respect to the finances can prevent
creating political controversy at later stages of policy
implementation. Two characteristics of a supple
policy are of particular importance; the first is
concerned with the ability to reduce or cease financial support dedicated to a specific technology
if the technology costs fall for whatever reason. The
German case-study (i.e. second blind-spot) reflects
the value of this option in the face of technology
costs falling faster than anticipated. 
</p><p>In the alternative case of renewable technology costs
not falling as fast as those of incumbent fossil fuel
supply chains, the danger is different. If the aim of
policies supporting renewable energy is achieved –
absolute reductions in consumption of fossil fuels –
an economy may suffer higher energy prices than its
competitors relying on fossil fuels. Renewables are
only competitive with conventional fuels when their
full cycle costs are comparable to the costs rather
than the current market prices of fossil fuels. The
continuing excess costs of renewables can only be
borne by one of three stakeholders: investors (and
their lenders), consumers, and taxpayers. There is no
magical fourth source of funding. These higher
energy costs are locked in once the capacity is
installed, because of the high capital, low operating
costs of wind and solar electricity. Furthermore,
unless investors are coerced, there is a maximum
contribution they will make based on their rate of
return requirements. This leaves the balance to be
shared between taxpayers and consumers, either
directly or indirectly.</p><p>It is not hard to imagine that governments seeking to
bolster their economies will succumb to the
temptation to reduce the costs of support to their
transition strategies. This may cause investors
relying upon incentives to fill the cost gap in their
economic comparisons of conventional and
renewable energy to hold back or require levels of
commitment that are politically difficult to provide.
At least in the current economic climate, energy
prices and taxes appear to exert more influence on an
electorate, and thus their political leaders, than an
appetite for a clean energy transition.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion Paper, Energy;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2014-11-06T13:22:26+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:39+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1410-DP04A-Changing-Competitive-Landscape_Transition-Policy’s-Blind-Spots.pdf;0;Shahad Albardi, Jorge Blazquez, Marcello Contestabile, Amro Elshurafa, Hind Farag, Kankana Dubey, Nora Nezamuddin, Tamim Zamrik;;;;;;;2014-10-06;2014-10-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

key elements of policy development in several countries. How will regulatory instruments
(policies, incentives, rebates, perks) impact the consumer behavior of new vehicle buyers (vehicle
choices, acceptance of alternative fuel vehicle technologies, stated and revealed preferences)? A
policy designer must understand how the policy can be aligned with consumer preferences in order
to achieve the societal goals but with minimal societal burden, and to effectively increase the
adoption rates of alternative fuel vehicles.</p><p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ul><li>KAPSARC’s automotive transportation research

the adoption of a range of new efficiency
technologies, but reducing greenhouse gas emissions
from transportation seems to be uniquely difficult.</li><li>As consumers of mobility upgrade from two-wheel

This workshop investigated one of the major emerging trends of China’s energy transformation: the development of sustainable fuel use. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Any discussion of sustainable fuel use in China is likely to start with the statistic that the last two decades have seen China move from being a net exporter of coal and oil to being the largest importer of both. Yet beyond the underlying surge in energy demand, the consumption of coal and oil raise very different sets of questions in terms of sustainability. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">For coal, the discussion largely centers on its environmental costs. The international debate on climate change and the domestic questions of poor urban air quality have thrown the spotlight on China’s ability to continue to use coal as it has in the past. In contrast, the discussion around the sustainable use of oil revolves around China’s rising oil import ratios and what this means in terms of the country’s involvement in the international energy markets and the actions necessary to ensure security of supply. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Despite the different questions, three distinct themes underscore the dangers of setting policy in isolation and failing to coordinate with other initiatives and so recognize the broader context:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> - Policies are a means to an end, not an end in themselves: policymakers will always respond to realized outcomes in the ongoing pursuit of their goals, and models of policy effectiveness risk irrelevance if they do not take this into account.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> - Policies that induce changes in consumer energy use do not necessarily drive desired changes in the underlying fuel mix. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">- Coordinating energy policies between economies in North East Asia has proved extremely difficult, but the potential benefits make it a priority still worth pursuing.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> As China’s importance in global energy markets continues to grow, the effect of its policy decisions will be felt throughout the world in economic, environmental and political arenas.

However, even in countries with policies designed to curb its supply and consumption, coal volumes have remained unexpectedly high. The key question for policymakers is: Why?</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Quantitative models can help navigate the complex dynamics of coal markets and to understand the potential impacts of policy prescriptions. Therefore, understanding the drivers of change in the coal industry is crucial to more effective decision making about coal. Within the last decade, coal has evolved into a truly global commodity. The consumption and production centers of North America, China, India, and Europe have coalesced into a complex system of integrated global coal flows. Domestic energy policies and domestic market conditions in one country can now influence coal production and demand around the globe. The key question is whether coal markets become even more integrated or, in the face of local policy drivers, revert to smaller regional markets? </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Despite a widespread view that coal is not a sustainable fuel, new technologies still have potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants significantly. Improvements in boiler technology, through the use of more advanced materials and manufacturing processes, can increase power plant efficiency by an additional 20-30%. Carbon capture and sequestration technology may help reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired generation; a key element of meeting stricter environmental standards. Coal production costs may also fall significantly in coming years as prices deepen the economic imperative to remain competitive. Mining technologies such as self-driving trucks, remotelyoperated drills, and automated longwalls are lowering costs and improving mine safety. But the question remains: Will all these advances be enough for the coal industry to remain competitive? </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Quantitative models have become an increasingly important tool used by policymakers, coal producers, traders, and the environmental community to understand the complex interactions of energy systems. These models are used to estimate transitions in a country’s fuel mix or shifts in global trade flow, identify efficiency gains, or analyze infrastructure bottlenecks. Model results are most useful when tempered with other aspects of the market, including political, social, and security objectives that affect policymakers’ decisions. How can modelers incorporate these unconventional drivers to make models more robust and insightful? </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Models of coal supply and consumption are easily quantifiable when predictable, liberalized markets are the norm. However, coal finds itself at the epicenter of a storm of externalities. Simple market competition models cannot properly predict future decisions that are based on more qualitative political judgments in which trade-offs between economic development, environmental sustainability and perceived energy security give no unique answer. Policy discontinuities challenge conventional models and demand a more flexible approach.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Coal Consumption , coal industry, Workshop Series;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-03-06T13:22:21+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:34+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1515-WB13A-Coal_Modeling-a-complex-fuel-source.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2015-03-06;2015-03-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The project’s objective is to understand what are the macroeconomic fundamentals that increase the resilience of a country to energy shocks and, in particular, the role of the energy mix in reducing vulnerability. The research will be complemented by an analysis of policies that enhance the resilience of economies to energy shocks.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Summary</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">It is common for decision makers and media to conflate the oil price with the price of energy. High crude oil prices are taken as signals of energy scarcity. By contrast, and perhaps misleadingly, low crude oil prices are perceived as evidence of energy abundance.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The first decade of the 21st century was characterized by a strong growth in emerging markets, accompanied by a gradual and persistent increase in crude oil prices. Emerging markets grew at an annual average of 6.5% during 2000-2007. At the same time, oil prices grew at an annual average rate of 21%. This increase in oil prices was a reflection of relative slow growth in crude oil production and rapid demand growth. However, these years were characterized by a relative abundance of energy from coal and, to some extent, natural gas. In particular, coal was the main source of the “additional energy” that fueled world economic growth during that period. This relative abundance of energy from coal and natural gas could partially explain why the increase in oil prices did not have as negative an impact on the global economy as many expected. On the contrary, the increase in the supply of coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas could be one of the reasons that explains the acceleration in global economic growth in the period 2000-2007. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The increase in coal consumption led to a significant change in the energy mix. In 2000, coal only amounted to 29% of the total consumption. In 2012, the share of coal in the fossil fuel energy mix was 34%, a level comparable to half a century ago. The shift in the world energy mix towards coal may be the result of a decrease in coal prices relative to oil and natural gas prices, complemented by accommodative policies in some key countries. Crude oil is still the largest source of energy, but the world has gradually been shifting towards more of a balance between oil, coal, and natural gas. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The surge in coal consumption appears to have impacted negatively on energy productivity growth, as coal use is less efficient than oil or natural gas from a technical and economic perspective. More energy from coal is required to achieve the same economic and calorific yield as is derived from oil. Despite an increase in energy productivity in key countries, the first years of the 21st century saw global energy productivity growing more slowly than in the past. One reason for this is that emerging economies, which were less productive from an energy perspective, grew faster than advanced economies and increased their weight in the global average before their energy productivity had reached OECD levels. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Perhaps one conclusion to be drawn from the period 2000-2007 is that governments of emerging economies will not easily turn their backs on a source of energy that is affordable and reliable to drive economic growth. The relative costs of energy are as important to them as social, political, and environmental considerations in shaping the global energy mix. However, the other side of the coin is that the increasing exposure of the global economy to coal and natural gas means that oil may cease to be the only source of energy shocks or disruptions. Oil prices may no longer be the sole barometer of energy shortages or abundance.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Oil Prices, energy abundance, coal consumption , Energy Costs, Discussion Paper;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-03-06T13:22:22+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:35+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1512-DP06A-How-coal-fueled-global-growth-and-slowed-energy-productivity-gains-in-the-early-21st-century.pdf;0;Tarek Atallah, Jorge Blazquez;;;;;;;2015-03-06;2015-03-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
embodied-energy-in-trade-what-role-does-specialization-play;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Embodied energy in trade: What role does specialization play;"<p><strong>About the project</strong> </p><p>The goal of this research project is to investigate how the embodied energy in trade influences energy use and productivity for each country. An understanding of each country’s embodied energy trade can enable better comparisons of energy indicators between countries, allowing for a more efficient design of energy policy targets. In line with KAPSARC’s overall objectives, this research project seeks to provide insights to policymakers that can be used to inform energy and environmental policy at both a national and an international level.</p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Summary</b></p><p>In global discussions aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions, the national targets set by governments are tied to the energy used or emissions generated within national borders. However, international trade can confuse the accounting. Moving a factory across the border does not change the total emissions, only the country to which they are attributed. Because of this, there is a growing consensus that the embodied emissions in international trade may undermine efforts to mitigate climate change.</p><p>This has led to a number of studies that investigate the embodied emissions in international trade. Their findings have consistently demonstrated that industrialized countries tend to be net importers of embodied energy and emissions, while developing countries tend to be net exporters. It is often assumed that the industrialized countries have “offshored” energy intensive industries to developing countries, which in turn have specialized in energy intensive production.</p><p>Some countries have started to adopt national targets around energy productivity, an indicator that links energy use to gross domestic product. Energy productivity has recently gained increased interest because it accommodates economic growth, is conceptually tied to energy efficiency - seen by policymakers as a low cost solution to limiting emissions - and focuses attention on how to maximize the welfare extracted from the energy system.</p><p>We examine the issue of offshoring and specialization through the lens of embodied energy. First, we calculate the embodied energy in the net exports of 41 economies. We then decompose the embodied energy in net exports for each economy into three effects - intensity, specialization, and the trade balance - to reveal why each economy is a net exporter or importer of embodied energy. Each effect is described below:</p><p>-The intensity effect loosely reflects how differences in energy efficiency influence the embodied energy in a country’s net exports. For example, consider two countries that engage in the trade of steel. Suppose each country is exporting the same volume of steel to the other. One of the countries would be a net exporter of embodied energy if it was less efficient in production, as its steel exports would embody more energy than its steel imports. </p><p>- The specialization effect captures how differences in the mix of goods and services that are traded influence the embodied energy in net exports. For example, if Saudi Arabia is exporting petrochemicals to the USA and importing various food products, then Saudi Arabia would be a net exporter of embodied energy due to its much more energy intensive exports. </p><p>- The trade balance effect reflects how differences in the volume of exports and imports influence the embodied energy in net exports. Returning to the steel example and allowing both countries to be equally efficient at producing steel, if one country exports ten tonnes of steel and imports five tonnes from the other country, the former will be a net exporter of embodied energy because of that trade surplus.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;embodied energy ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-03-06T13:22:22+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:35+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1516-DP010A-Embodied-energy-in-trade_What-role-does-specialization-play.pdf;0;Anwar Gasim;;;;;;;2015-03-06;2015-03-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In addition to being a source for traditional temperature-based degree days, the team has presented a novel approach that incorporates the effect of humidity and solar radiation by deriving degree days from thermal comfort indices. Its intent is to provide a quantitative means for assessing climatic effects when performing energy-related analyses.</p><p>Please see the link below for the CMCC-KAPSARC Database: </p><p><a href=""https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Enhanced-Degree-Days-Database-March-2015.xlsx"">https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11...</a></p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Weather can have a profound effect on energy consumption, especially extremes of hot and cold temperatures. These variations in particular drive residential and commercial energy demand because space heating and cooling is such an important component. Traditional approaches are customized to the specific geography of interest. Energy regulators use a measure of divergence from normal temperatures to estimate peaks in demand when planning future capacity, or to strip out short-term weather effects to identify underlying growth trends. Energy traders marry weather forecasts to demand data to identify potential price peaks and troughs. What unites these analyses is that they tend to be either local or short term in nature; or both. However, the customization of methodology to a particular geography renders comparisons of the effects of weather between countries invalid. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Targets for improving energy productivity and benchmarking of performance towards meeting such targets between countries requires a consistent global database, both spatially and temporally. To date, no such database has been available to policymakers. KAPSARC has worked with the Euro -Mediterranean Center for Climate Change (CMCC) to create a database covering 147 countries over a period of several decades, based on consistent methodologies such that the impacts of local climate on energy consumption can be analyzed. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Differences in the energy productivity of countries are comprised of several factors. These include the industrial structure of the economy, efficiency of equipment and processes, availability of water, and differences in weather - among other factors. Differentiating between the factors that are controllable (including economic structure and efficiency) and uncontrollable (including weather and access to water), allows policy to be focused in the areas where it can achieve the most beneficial impact. The CMCC-KAPSARC Weather Normalization Database is one of the tools now available to policymakers to separate the signal from the noise in guiding policies aimed at improving the energy productivity of their economies.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Energy Consumption, CMCC-KAPSARC Weather Normalization Database, Weather Normalization Database, Discussion Paper ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-04-06T13:22:21+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:34+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/KS-1514-DP08A-A-global-degree-days-database-for-energy-related-applications_for-web.pdf;0;Tarek Atallah, Alessandro Lanza, Silvio Gualdi;;;;;;;2015-04-06;2015-04-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;Euro-Mediterranean Center for Climate Change (CMCC);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was conducted under the rule of capturing the discussion on a non-attribution basis. Thirty international and local experts participated</p><p><strong>Summary for policymakers</strong></p><p>Members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) play a key role in the global energy system. Collectively, in 2014 the six countries supplied the global market with over 28 million barrels of oil equivalent per day of oil and natural gas. They also hold approximately 30% of global proven oil reserves, according to the 2014 BP Statistical Review. The oil and natural gas sector dominates local economic activity, constituting 44% of the region’s gross domestic product and 82% of government revenues in 2013. Beyond the upstream sector, a substantial share of the non-oil exports are still derived from crude oil and natural gas; the region is a large exporter of refined products and petrochemicals. Additionally, public government expenditure has been the main driver of infrastructure and services development in recent years. Thus, the activity of oil and gas production permeates almost the entire economy. The high dependence on hydrocarbon export revenues has placed economic diversification among the key issues for local policymakers.</p><p>Also, the region has experienced significant economic growth throughout most of the last decade, driven by the rise in oil prices. High oil revenues have allowed for an increase in public investment, and for local governments to bear the costs of providing inexpensive fuel and electricity to consumers. For the most part, households and local industries enjoy a set of administered energy prices that are well below global market values. These prices, which are intended to catalyze industrialization and achieve social objectives, have economy-wide ramifications. Economic growth and low energy prices have contributed to a rapid increase in domestic energy use. Some of the solutions proposed by policymakers to curb regional oil and gas consumption have included the adoption of alternative power generation technologies and enforcing higher efficiency standards. </p><p>In recent years, models have been built for individual countries within the GCC to assess how sectors in an economy interact by characterizing the operational and investment decisions in the energy system. These models are diverse in methodology and the resolution at which the economy is represented; some take a partial view of the economy while others find an economy-wide general equilibrium. </p><p>Although the members of the GCC share the challenges and opportunities of hydrocarbon-driven economies and face similar development issues, no model has been built for the aggregate GCC energy economy. Initiatives that propose a shared energy infrastructure (regional gas and electricity grids) may not have been able to assess the costs and benefits at the level of the aggregate economy of the region. However integrated, shared infrastructure requires at least three layers of foundation to succeed: </p><p>- Common definitions and transparent sharing of data </p><p>- Consistent and, ideally, integrated models of the member country energy economies </p><p>- Consistent and harmonized regulatory </p><p>regimes that do not create exploitable arbitrages KAPSARC’s research is seeking to drive the first pre-requisite by building models of the energy economies of the GCC members in partnership with local think tanks and research institutions. Calibration of these models will expose differences in data definitions and availability that can be harmonized before proposing policies that optimize the benefits of shared infrastructure.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;;;en;;2015-05-06T13:22:21+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:33+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1516-WB14A-Models-for-the-economies-and-energy-systems.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2015-05-06;2015-05-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This is based on simple extrapolations which suggest that in a little more than 20 years Saudi Arabia may become a net importer of hydrocarbon fuels.</div> <div>However, our research does not support this. Based on   the   “baseline   scenario”   macroeconomic assumptions in Oxford Economics’ global economic and  industry  models,  we  project  Saudi  Arabia’s energy  balances  until  2032  using  the  KAPSARC </div> <div>Energy Model (KEM). We analyze several cases:</div> <br/><ul><li>continuation of current pricing policies; </li><li>immediate deregulation of fuel prices; </li><li>phased deregulation of fuel prices; and </li><li>a  combination  of  incentives  and  small  price increases  that  capture  many  of  the  benefits  of deregulation.</li></ul> <div>Our  projections  suggest  that  implementing  these </div> <div>alternative  fuel-pricing  and  technology  investment </div><p>policies  would  likely  encourage  the  adoption  of more   efficient   power   generation   and   water desalination  technologies.  The  alternative  policies alter the transfer prices of fuels between sectors, but maintain  the  prices  at  which  energy  is  sold  to households.

reforming-the-role-of-state-owned-enterprise-in-chinas-energy-sector;;;;China;APAC;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Reforming the Role of State-Owned Enterprise in China’s Energy Sector;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">What are the prospects for reform of the Chinese energy sector? This question is the subject of much debate both inside and outside China. Since coming to power in November 2012, China’s new government has issued a series of statements on reform, clearly an important part of the country’s continuing ‘great revival’. Despite this, some experts have been unconvinced by the pace of economic reform. What reform means for the energy sector is even less clear. There are competing views on how, and to what extent, the energy sector and energy policy will be reformed, but they all share various potential biases resulting from incomplete data and “not knowing what we don’t know”. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We approach this policy question by addressing the decision-making process about whether or not to open up the upstream oil and gas market in China to competition from small, private enterprise. We examine two related aspects: </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">- the appetite for policy reform that would allow private enterprise to more fully compete in China’s energy sector; and</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> - the appetite for direct reform of the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), limiting its market dominance to complement such reforms so as to allow smaller companies to utilize the competitive space opened up in the sector. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">To analyze the direction of policy in these two aspects, we apply a framework for modeling collective decision-making processes (CDMPs): the KAPSARC Toolkit for Behavioral Analysis (KTAB). KTAB is not a model, but a platform for building models. It is a CDMP simulator that can generate insight into policy decision-making. It allows the researcher to apply a set of rules of engagement on a question and then simulate the CDMP to understand how the advocacy and influence of actors may evolve to influence the range of plausible policy outcomes. As such, KTAB enables analysts to bring a quantitative approach to what has traditionally been a qualitative field. This technique draws on the insights of experts regarding the advocacy and interactions among decision makers and influencers, capturing expert knowledge in a methodical, consistent manner.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> In this paper, we examine the interactions of actors’ interests that may be driving China to reform its energy sector policies and, in particular, the structure of CNPC. The question is important. Many commentators and policy makers have suggested that adjustments are needed to reduce the constraints on the involvement of private enterprise in the Chinese upstream oil and gas sector. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Data for the KTAB model used in this paper were gathered through interviews with several experts, inside and outside China, both directly and indirectly involved in the Chinese energy sector. We combined their individual responses into a consensus expertbased view of the interests and opinions of the relevant decision makers. KTAB provides a framework to evaluate the implications of different sets of expert views (the data). Our use of what we call the consensus view data should not be taken to imply that the data provided by the experts are “objective facts” regarding the actors. Instead we argue that these data represent an informed understanding of the decision makers and therefore allow KTAB simulations to identify plausible policy outcomes, rather than predicted or forecasted outcomes, given the embedded insights of our experts.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the case of private companies’ entry into the energy markets in China, the KTAB simulations suggest that little substantive reform is likely, which would come as a surprise to many of the experts who provided data for this analysis. During the interviews with our set of experts, most anticipated substantive reform. Our analysis using KTAB, on the other hand, suggests that the inertia of key actors within the decision-making sphere holds back the potential for a significant opening up of the energy sector. In addition, despite the possible erosion of CNPC’s political clout, there does not appear to be consensus among the critical decision makers in China in favor of major reform of its market position.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> These insights appear robust. Scenario analysis around the baseline KTAB simulation results suggests institutional inertia limits the effectiveness of unilateral initiatives by any of the key leaders— unilateral attempts to drive reform are not sufficient to alter the outcome. Attempts to push through a wholesale reform of CNPC appear to require more concerted action by a coalition of interests than is likely to come together at present. Despite a political environment in China where significant reform appears in rhetoric, there does not appear to be much credible space for meaningful reform of private sector involvement in the Chinese energy markets.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>";KAPSARC Publications;CNPC, KTAB, Energy Sector, CDMP;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-07-06T13:22:19+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:32+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1520-DP014A-Reforming-the-Role-of-State-Owned-Enterprise-in-China’s-Energy-Sector-web.pdf;0;Brian Efird, Ben Wise, Leo Lester, Lama   Yaseen, Imtenan    Al - Mubarak;;;;;;;2015-07-06;2015-07-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Their economic viability depends only on whether the renewable power source can generate electricity more cheaply than the fuels that it displaces. The framework used here by KAPSARC compares standalone plants that are powered only by renewable energy and therefore incorporate storage, either of input energy to allow the plant to run full time or of produced water to level out the production of an oversized plant. The commerciality of such approaches is a function of the relative costs of three elements: </p><ul><li>energy storage (electricity or heat); </li><li>the cost of standby desalination capacity (including treated water storage); or </li><li>the relative costs of renewable and conventional energy. Our research shows that, with the present state of technology, membrane plants are more cost-effective than thermal plants. It is also more cost-effective to oversize the desalination plant and store water on the back end than to store electric power on the front end. The best current configurations are only competitive if the opportunity cost of the avoided fuel consumption is more than $60/barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).</li></ul>";KAPSARC Publications;solar desalination, framework, desalination , Combined Cycle Gas Turbine , CCGT, Multi Effect Distillation, MED, Multi Stage Flash, MSF, reverse osmosis, RO, Discussion Paper;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-08-06T13:22:18+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:30+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/37_KS-1521-DP015A-A-Framework-for-Comparing-the-Viability-of-Different-Desalination-Approaches.pdf;0;Christopher Napoli, Bertrand Williams-Rioux;;;;;;;2015-08-06;2015-08-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In developing these reserves, Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda have the chance to rapidly transform their economies and address development needs. However, this opportunity comes with risks and policy challenges, and dependency on natural resources for economic growth has been frequently linked to poor macroeconomic performance in developing countries. KAPSARC is working collaboratively with leading economic policy think tanks in four countries to understand one central question: How can countries develop their natural resources to create and sustain inclusive economic development? Aspects of this include: </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. The role of oil and gas fiscal regimes in promoting natural resource development; </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">2. The role of local content regulations and indigenization in shaping the impact of natural resource-driven development; and </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">3. The macroeconomic impact of local content regulations and indigenization of natural resource development under different fiscal policy scenarios. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The workshop yielded several insights for policymakers in resource-rich developing countries: </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. Managing a country’s expectations, particularly in the communities surrounding natural resource extraction sites, is often overlooked in the negotiations about fiscal regimes;</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 2. Fiscal regime negotiations are sometimes overly focused on the concept of ‘government take’, which can ignore the important issue of the tradeoffs imposed on the international oil companies (IOCs) that ultimately commit to investments in the oil and gas sector;</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> 3. Local content policies are a political imperative for oil and gas projects in Eastern Africa and all parties should recognize this; </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">4. The legacy of mining industries in many African countries has left a wake of resentment and mistrust among local communities that is driving the debate over local content policies in the oil and gas sectors; and </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">5. The significant social welfare and development needs in East African countries require different fiscal policies for managing natural resource revenues than those prescribed for industrialized nations. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;natural resources, macroeconomic performance;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-08-06T13:22:18+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:30+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1520-WB18A-The-Challenges-of-Developing-Eastern-Africa’s-Natural-Resources.pdf;0;Anne - Sophie  Corbeau, Artem Malov, Tilak Doshi, Baltasar Manzano, Fakhri Hasanov, Marcelo Neuman, Fred Joutz, Roger Tissot, Daniel Mabrey, Akil Zaimi;;;;;;;2015-08-06;2015-08-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The goal of this research project is to study the other side of the coin—the security of oil demand from the net-exporters perspective. How do large oil exporters trade off risk and rewards in ensuring security of demand?</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the first phase of this research project, the project develops a comparative static model of global oil trade to empirically measure the impacts of alternative crude oil market shares across segmented markets; to assess the strategic choice NOCs have in valuing alternative sales market portfolios in the context of the trade-off along the risk- reward frontier; and to compare IOC behavior as a benchmark for NOCs.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">More specifically, this project will attempt to specify a parsimonious model of regionally segmented global oil trade calibrated to 2012 benchmark data which would allow comparative static exercises to simulate equilibrium impacts of alternative placement of term-contracted crude oil, including impacts on total revenues for crude oil producers. The model focuses on three fundamental variables that determine relative crude oil prices: transport costs, crude oil quality, and refinery flexibility.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In line with KAPSARC’s overall objectives, the intent is to produce policy-relevant insights that help actors in the oil industry understand the consequences of decisions taken by large exporters. The workshop series fits into the overall project by providing a continuing dialogue that raises key issues, provides feedback on current work, and sets future directions. The workshops are an open collaborative forum that enables the discussion of particular themes that feed into identified research questions.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Diversification of supply or demand is normally viewed as reducing risks but imposing costs. KAPSARC has developed a framework that suggests this is not always the case. Among our conclusions are:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> - Large crude suppliers may increase their revenues by allocating volumes to more distant markets, if by doing so they capture locational rents from more proximate buyers. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">- Based on the 2012 configuration of global oil markets, any significant coalition of Arabian Gulf exporters can exploit this opportunity. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">- Large crude buyers may reduce their costs by purchasing volumes from more distant suppliers, counteracting the strategies of their nearest suppliers.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> - No single buyer is currently large enough to position itself to benefit from supplier diversification. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Long-term future reconfigurations, such as North American volumes becoming available in the Pacific markets or a Russian supply pivot from Europe to North East Asia, might alter the ability of current Middle East exporters to increase revenues while achieving greater customer diversity.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Global Oil Trade Model, GOTM, Supply Diversification ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-08-06T13:22:19+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:31+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1522-DP016A-Asian-Premium-or-North-Atlantic-Discount.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2015-08-06;2015-08-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
natural-gas-entering-the-new-dark-age;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Natural Gas: Entering the New Dark Age;<p><strong>About the workshop </strong></p><p>In March 2015, KAPSARC convened the first workshop in its global gas markets energy workshop series. The workshop was hosted by the Clingendael International Energy Programme at the Huys Clingendael in The Hague, The Netherlands. The workshop, attended by policymakers, researchers and industry practitioners, was conducted on the basis that the discussions could be reported on a non-attribution basis.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>Many in the natural gas industry view the rise in the share of natural gas in the global energy mix as inevitable. However, this industry optimism is not reflected in the approach of policymakers. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets provide an insight into the state of the global gas business, because:</p><ul><li> The next wave of LNG supply projects is faced with uncertain demand growth—in Europe because of substitution by Russian imports and in Asia because of competition with coal. </li><li>Imported natural gas is expensive relative to coal and, for the time being, developing countries value low cost energy for industrialization ahead of long-term environmental risks. </li><li> North American LNG will likely secure a significant market share but does not guarantee lower prices for Asian consumers. </li><li> Despite importer appetite to move away from long-term LNG contracts, often indexed to oil prices, it is far from certain that sellers will be capable of financing major infrastructure in the absence of such contracts.</li></ul><p>Whatever the future holds, we can be certain that it will be different than the one envisaged as recently as five years ago and, probably, than the one we can envisage today.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;LNG, final investment decisions , FID, Liquefied natural gas, Workshop series ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-08-06T13:22:19+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:31+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1519-WB17A-Natural-Gas_-Entering-the-New-Dark-Age.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2015-08-06;2015-08-06;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
has-coal-come-to-a-fork-in-the-road;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Has Coal Come to a Fork in the Road?;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fuel mix forecasts tend to fall into one of two categories. One says that coal, and fossil fuels more generally, will enjoy growing demand and supply based on their expected economic competitiveness. The alternative sees fossil fuels, and coal in particular, as falling victim to policies designed to transition to a low carbon economy. Which of these two potential outcomes takes place appears to depend on the extent to which the developing economies that rely on coal for their growth can bear the additional costs of alternatives. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">History shows that the future can differ widely from expectations. Only 15 years ago it was common to assume that coal was a declining energy source—a relic of 20th century industrialization. In fact, it has grown more quickly than any other source of energy and, by some estimates, may exceed even oil as the largest component of the global energy mix. Whatever the future holds, it will likely be different than the one imagined. One of the most pressing questions on the minds of policymakers is therefore: what should the future be for coal? </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Coal faces an almost certain future of declining demand in the West, contrasted by a very likely increase in consumption in Asia and the rest of the developing world. In particular, China and India have become the central focus of future discussion as, together, they consume over 60 percent of the coal produced in the world. Efficiency improvements in power generation and technology pathways to lowering the environmental impact of coal use do not come without challenges. But success in either of these two dimensions may not produce enough abatement to reverse coal’s negative impacts. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">An agreement on climate change at the UN Climate Change Summit (COP21) meeting in Paris would have an enormous potential impact on coal demand provided it incorporates approaches to implementation that ensure compliance. Even then, any significant decline in coal demand would lead to appreciably lower prices than are seen today and could create more headroom to invest in measures that abate the environmental impacts of coal use. The future could see more coal than its detractors intend and less than its promoters hope. However, the long lead times, installed capital stock and relatively low cost of coal as an energy source will ensure that it continues to be an important part of the global energy mix during any reasonable planning horizon.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Coal’s future depends on politics and technology. The world currently seems divided between the OECD members—attempting to phase coal out of their energy mix—and much of the rest of the world that is torn between access to cheap energy and its environmental impacts. This leaves governments faced with convincing their citizens to pay for climate change policy before securing access to their basic needs. Regardless of which view prevails:</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> - Even the externalities of renewable energy development, such as intermittency, reliability and system efficiency impacts, will not be sufficient to prevent coal becoming commercially uncompetitive, particularly if a global climate deal is achieved that imposes carbon pricing.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> - China may cease to be a major importer of coal. It is planning to reduce coal’s share in its energy mix and may even reduce coal demand in absolute terms.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> - India may pick up the slack resulting from any reduced global coal market role for China. However, India’s ambitious plans to boost domestic production could stymie such hopes. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">- For now, coal is winning the ‘battle for Asia’ against natural gas, based on its affordability, but its future depends on successful, widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS).</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> Coal is clearly approaching a fork in the road and it will not be long before we have a clearer view of which turning it will take.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Fuel mix,  fossil fuels, Energy   ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-08-11T13:22:17+00:00;False;False;;2018-11-21T07:02:30+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/KS-1522-WB20A-Has-Coal-Come-to-a-Fork-in-the-Road1.pdf;0;Kankana Dubey, Berenice  Garcia - Tellez, Rodrigo Echeverri, Nicholas Howarth;;;;;;;2015-08-11;2015-08-11;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The principle research question we are seeking to answer is, how can natural resources be developed in a way that promotes inclusive economic development. We are answering this question through a comprehensive framework that examines macroeconomic issues of natural resource development, the impact of local content policies, and understanding the expectations of stakeholders in countries' oil and gas sectors.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>Recent Eastern African hydrocarbon discoveries bring opportunities hand-in-hand with challenges, including: </p><ul><li> ‘Dutch disease’, which results in reduced international competitiveness because the real exchange rate rises; </li><li> The ‘resource curse’, where resource wealth adversely affects governance and leads to rent seeking behaviors. These may cause natural resource-rich economies to perform worse than others which remain resource poor. </li><li>Uncritical adherence to the ‘permanent income hypothesis’ (PIH), which advocates converting resource capital into non-resource assets, then spending only the income generated from it (in real terms), so the principal will be preserved for future generations. </li><li> ‘Absorptive capacity’ constraints, which may limit the ability of workers and institutions to fully adopt and employ both new strategies and new infrastructure so the economy can expand. </li></ul><p>Our summary of the literature relating to these four challenges and their potential solutions lays the groundwork for two related KAPSARC research papers detailing a calibrated macroeconomic model of the Ugandan economy and a quantification of the scale of social benefits that might follow from oil development.

a-calibrated-macroeconomic-model-for-uganda;;;;Uganda;EMEA;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;A Calibrated Macroeconomic Model for Uganda;<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p><p> KAPSARC is engaged in a long-term research project examining the dynamics of natural resource-driven growth in Eastern Africa. The principle research question we are seeking to answer is, how can natural resources be developed in a way that promotes inclusive economic development? We are answering this question through a comprehensive framework that examines macroeconomic issues of natural resource development, the impact of local content policies, and understanding the expectations of the stakeholders in East Africa’s oil and gas sectors.</p><p><strong>Summary for Eastern Africa Policymakers</strong></p><p>Recent natural resource discoveries in Eastern Africa provide an opportunity to boost economic development. However, this opportunity brings with it potential challenges in the form of ‘Dutch disease’ and, potentially, the ‘resource curse’. A companion paper to this report: Managing Macroeconomic Risks Arising from Natural Resource Revenues in Developing Countries: A review of the Challenges for East Africa sets out the current state of thinking on the issues of Dutch disease, resource curse, the applicability of the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) in populous, developing economies and the impact of absorptive capacity constraints.</p><p>Our focus is oil discoveries in Uganda and their expected impact on government revenues. We analyze alternative policies for spending natural resource revenues using a calibrated dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model (DSGE) of the Ugandan economy. These policy scenarios encompass the range of outcomes that are likely to be considered by the Ugandan government and provide a framing for subsequent policy discussions on how best to deploy the windfall.</p><p>Using detailed publicly-available information on the upstream oil sector and the fiscal regime, we have derived realistic cost and government revenue profiles across a range of oil price scenarios. These profiles assume that proposed local content regulations neither delay project development nor increase the costs compared to international norms. This enables us to project annual production, fixed and variable costs, and government revenues for three global oil price paths.</p><div>The three scenarios illustrate the potential effects of:</div><ul><li>Direct income transfers.</li><li>Front loaded public investment spending.</li><li>Gradual public investment spending</li></ul><p>Within these scenarios, we also assess the impacts of alternative assumptions on the efficiency of public investment arising from constraints on absorptive capacity within the economy.</p><p>The results of the three different policy choices can be contrasted to show the tradeoffs between short term welfare benefits at the expense of long term economic performance. No single economic choice can be considered optimal in the absence of considering the political and social consequences of each individual policy choice. For this reason, we make no specific recommendation as to which approach to choose but provide a framework for policy discussions.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;permanent income hypothesis, PIH,  macroeconomic , natural resources, Discussion paper ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-12-24T13:22:15+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:27+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/46_KS-1526-DP020A-A-Calibrated-Macroeconomic-Model-for-Uganda.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2015-12-24;2015-12-24;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
the-prospects-for-coal-fired-power-generation-in-saudi-arabia;;;;Saudi Arabia;EMEA;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;The Prospects for Coal-fired Power Generation in Saudi Arabia;<div><strong>Key Points:</strong><br/><br/>Almost all of Saudi Arabia’s electric power generation is fueled by oil and gas. Plans for future capacity envisage nuclear and renewables supplementing this mix and freeing up oil for other revenue-generating opportunities. Coal-fired generation has been promoted in some Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries but not, so far, in the Kingdom. Our analysis finds that: </div><ul><li>At current administered prices of oil and gas, other resources of energy such as solar, nuclear, or imported coal are not competitive for power generation.</li></ul><p>If decisions were made based on deregulated oil and gas prices: </p><ul><li>with the reference coal price, only moderate levels of coal-fired capacity would be introduced. If the remaining capacity were made up of nuclear and solar, this would result in lower Saudi CO2 emissions from power generation than under a ‘business as usual’ scenario.  </li><li>with the low coal price, CO2 emissions in 2030 cannot be maintained at their current level since coal, rather than solar and nuclear, is used to displace oil and gas from the generation fuel mix.</li></ul><p>Some forecasts of coal markets anticipate significant increases in real export prices, which would make coal-fired power generation unattractive compared with constructing nuclear power.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>About the Project<br/></strong></p> <div>We developed the KAPSARC Energy Model for Saudi Arabia (KEM-SA) to understand the dynamics of the country’s energy system. It is a partial equilibrium model formulated as a mixed complementarity problem to capture the administered prices that permeate the local economy. KEM-SA has been previously used to study the impacts of various industrial fuel pricing policies and improved residential efficiency on the energy economy. In the present paper, we use it to assess the feasibility of a power generation technology.</div>;KAPSARC Publications;;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-12-24T13:22:15+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:27+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/45_KS-1528-DP022A-The-Prospects-for-Coal-fired-Power-Generation-in-Saudi-Arabia.pdf;0;Walid Matar, Rodrigo Echeverri, Axel Pierru;;;;;;;2015-12-24;2015-12-24;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It was conducted on the basis that the discussions could be reported on a non-attribution basis.</p><p><strong>About KAPSARC’s Research on Energy Vulnerability </strong></p><p>KAPSARC’s research on energy vulnerability looks at energy shocks and disruptions from the perspective of both exporting and importing economies. Our objective is to understand what are the macroeconomic fundamentals that increase the resilience of an economy to energy shocks and, in particular, the role of the energy mix in reducing vulnerability. This will lead to an analysis of policies that enhance the resilience of economies to energy shocks.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>The economic vulnerability of an economy to energy disruptions is traditionally viewed through the lens of price shocks. This 'energy vulnerability' is driven by the energy mix, the infrastructure and the supply chain resilience that an economy enjoys.</p><ul><li>Globally, the energy mix appears to be determined by the relative costs of fuels. </li><li>Regionally, the mix may be distorted by policies addressing security, environmental, economic and other social aspects. </li><li>Such policies may create economic vulnerabilities to the same extent as price shocks. </li><li>Policies designed to stabilize energy prices rather than to insulate an economy from price volatility may, ironically, lead to greater swings in prices in the long-term. As technology and regulation change the relative competitiveness of energy sources, stabilization mechanisms may create unsustainable imbalances—creating even greater hardship when they unwind</li></ul>;KAPSARC Publications; prices, energy, energy security, Workshop series ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2015-12-24T13:22:16+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:28+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/42_KS-1524-WB22A-The-Economics-of-Energy-Vulnerability.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2015-12-24;2015-12-24;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

step-by-step-the-reform-of-chinas-energy-economy;;;;China;APAC;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Step by Step: The Reform of China’s Energy Economy;<p><strong>About the Project </strong></p><p>Our goal is to understand the context of China’s energy economy, decision-making process and (even) social mores. This understanding will enable the collection of relevant and accurate data both to feed analysis and drive the interpretation of model outputs. The project aims to analyze and assess information to obtain policy relevant insights. Its focus is on investigating the global consequences of changes to energy markets within China.</p><p> The overall objective is to combine an understanding of the fundamentals of China’s energy economy, derived from KAPSARC’s Energy Model for China, and of the policy landscape, through the construction of the KAPSARC Energy Policy Database. The two platforms and the associated knowledge can then be used to answer a range of questions around the reform of China’s energy sector, ultimately leading to an informed view on the future of China’s energy mix.</p><p> In line with KAPSARC’s overall objectives, the aim is to produce policy relevant insights that may assist actors outside China to understand the consequences of decisions taken by actors in China. </p><p>The Energy Workshop Series supports the overall project by providing a space for a continuing dialogue that raises the key issues, provides feedback on current work and can set future directions. In addition, the workshops are an open collaborative forum that enables the discussion of particular questions that feed into the overarching research agenda</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><ul><li>Reform has dominated political discussion in China at least since Xi Jinping took over the leadership at the end of 2012. There is increasing understanding both inside and outside China that the economy is rebalancing from export – led growth toward domestic consumption. This emerging ‘new China’ is making reform – including reform of the energy economy – ever more necessary and urgent.</li><li>China’s successes have elevated it to a middle-income country, but with this have come new challenges and new targets, not least of which surround the dependence upon coal and the regulation of its energy sector. The ambition of doubling per capita GDP once again will require an updated economic growth model and an optimized energy fuel-mix. It also implies the emergence of a more affluent society with new expectations to be met, and the development of a more predictable regulatory system</li><li>Neither the need for reform nor its urgency is open to doubt, only the route to be followed. Incrementalism in reforming the energy economy emerges as key if China’s leaders are to confound the skeptics once again.</li></ul>;KAPSARC Publications;energy markets,  Energy Model,  energy economy, Workshop series ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-03-21T13:22:15+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:26+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/KS-1625-WB024A-Step-by-Step-The-Reform-of-China’s-Energy-Economy1.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2016-03-21;2016-03-21;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

group-choice-with-interdependent-sublinear-voting;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Group Choice with Interdependent Sublinear Voting;"<p><strong>About the Project </strong></p><p>KAPSARC is developing the KAPSARC Toolkit for Behavioral Analysis (KTAB), an open source software platform, to support modeling and analysis of collective decision making processes (CDMPs). Within our research, KTAB is intended to be the standard platform for analyzing bargaining problems, generalized voting models and policy decision making. It is our intent to use KTAB to assemble the building blocks for a broad class of CDMPs. Typical models in KTAB will draw on the insights of subject matter experts regarding decision makers and influencers in a methodical, consistent manner and will then assist researchers to identify feasible outcomes that are the result of CDMPs.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Many important decisions of policy are made in a collective manner, so a great deal of formal and informal analysis has been devoted to collective decision-making processes (CDMPs). One common approach to analyzing CDMPs is first to model the participants as exercising their ‘votes’ independently, and secondly to solve the model and identify a range of feasible outcomes. A potential criticism of this approach is that the actors may strategically modify their behaviors based on the behaviors of others. If such interdependent voting behaviors led to different outcomes, it would undermine the validity of analysis based on independent voting.</p><p>In this paper, we compare and contrast two models of collective choice. The first assumes that each participant decides how much effort to exert as if they were acting alone; the second assumes that each participant strategically takes into account the effort exerted by other participants. While the first model is simpler, the second is more realistic.</p><p>This paper demonstrates that they produce the same collective outcome: the simple model can be used without sacrificing realism. </p><p>More formally, we demonstrate the mathematical equivalence of these two different CDMPs:</p><ul><li>The simple strategy of independent proportional voting, and some simple results of applying it.</li><li>The consequences when actors strategically modify their behavior to take into account each other’s actions.</li></ul><p>There are some subtle differences in how the ‘negotiations’ play out — the actors do tend to exert less effort because of free rider effects — but overall the modified CDMP gives the same result</p><p>Thus, we can analyze CDMPs as if the actors used independent proportional voting and remain confident that the final result is also correct should actors be using more strategically sophisticated behavior.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;KTAB, Toolkit for Behavioral Analysis, CDMP,  collective decision making processes, Methodology papers ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-04-05T13:22:15+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:26+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KS-1629-MP023B-Group-Choice-with-Interdependent-Sublinear-Voting_Methodology-Paper.pdf;0;Ben Wise;;;;;;;2016-04-05;2016-04-05;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

how-will-natural-gas-adapt-to-the-new-price-environment;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;How Will Natural Gas Adapt to the New Price Environment?;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">KAPSARC is analyzing the shifting dynamics of the global gas markets. Global gas markets have turned upside down during the past five years: North America has emerged as a large potential future LNG exporter while gas demand growth has been slowing down as natural gas gets squeezed between coal and renewables. While the coming years will witness the fastest LNG export capacity expansion ever seen, many questions are raised on the next generation of LNG supply, the impact of low oil and gas prices on supply and demand patterns and how pricing and contractual structure may be affected by both the arrival of US LNG on global gas markets and the desire of Asian buyers for cheaper gas.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the period 2011-14, buyers – particularly in Europe and Asia – argued that high natural gas prices had been the main obstacle preventing the fuel from fulfilling its promise and increasing its share in the primary energy mix. Key gas price indices have dropped across the world in tandem with oil and the previous situation no longer prevails. Perhaps it is time for new perspectives for gas markets.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Demand for gas has yet to be boosted by the fall in prices over the last two years, though some regions show promise.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Gas faces competition not only from coal but, more recently, from cheap oil as well. Meanwhile, policies promote renewables and energy efficiency. Consequently, the prospects for natural gas would stand a greater chance once policymakers begin to account properly for coal’s externalities. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The rapid change in gas prices will force investors to operate assets on the basis of variable costs. Some players, notably those holding U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity, may not be able to sustain financial difficulties for long, especially if a price war emerges in Europe. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The current reduced upstream investment climate could lead to a slower gas production recovery. If demand picks up in a few years’ time, production rates could prove insufficient. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The need for flexibility and divergences between term and spot prices could favor the earlier emergence of another trading hub in Asia, although its specificities and location remain unclear.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Gas Prices, New Gas Price ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-04-11T13:22:14+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:26+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KS-1626-WB025A-How-Will-Natural-Gas-Adapt-to-the-New-Price-Environment.pdf;0;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;2016-04-11;2016-04-11;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

energy-for-water-in-agriculture;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Energy for Water in Agriculture;<p><strong>About the Project </strong></p><p>The project’s objective is to understand how and why the energy required to meet water demand differs between countries. To explore this question, energy used for the extraction, treatment, and transport of water is decomposed. The decomposition offers an empirical base through which to examine how energy is used in the water cycle in countries.</p><p> Building on this empirical base, the project explores the controllable and less controllable factors that lead to differences in energy use for water provision. Particular consideration is given to the effects of industrial structure, pollution, water scarcity and pricing strategies on energy and water use.</p><p> In line with KAPSARC’s overall objectives, the project seeks to provide insights into how current policies influence the energy used for water withdrawals, and where improvements might be made. By exploring case studies from around the globe, the project highlights how successful practices in water and energy management from one country might be transferred to others. </p><p>The workshop series provides a space for dialogue on key issues, feedback on KAPSARC's study program, and options for future research.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><ul><li>Managing the closely interlinked water-energy-food nexus requires a holistic approach, as inefficient use of any of the three resources can have a negative effect on the other two. In countries with high rainfall, policy makers rarely need to worry about the nexus. But elsewhere, the effects are felt throughout the economy.</li><li>There is significant variance in the productivity of water for agriculture, and the energy required to extract that water, across countries.

substitutes-for-liquid-fuels-outlook-in-a-low-oil-price-environment;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Substitutes for Liquid Fuels – Outlook in a Low Oil Price Environment;"<p><strong>About the Workshop</strong></p><p>KAPSARC convened a workshop in December 2015 with some 40 international experts in the areas of global oil markets, alternative fuels, electric vehicles and venture capital, to discuss the impact of lower oil prices on the future of alternative liquid fuels. The workshop was held under Chatham House rules.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>The case for alternatives to gasoline and diesel was historically built on economic concerns; that the world might be running out of oil, which would then become prohibitively expensive. More recently, the argument has been refocused around carbon abatement and avoiding the social costs of climate change.</p><ul><li>In the past, initiatives to pursue alternatives to oil would have come to a halt if confronted with the precipitous fall in oil prices seen over the past 18 months. </li><li>Today, the impetus to continue investing in technologies that can be cost competitive with refined oil products is provided by global climate governance discussions. The outlook is therefore unlikely to be affected by short term oil price weakness. </li><li>Innovators attempting to find viable alternatives to oil are now more likely to be venture capital backed entrepreneurs than major oil companies. </li><li>The target ‘cost’ for low carbon alternatives is not based on the current or expected future price of oil but the underlying cost of oil development and production (excluding fiscal rents) plus the social cost of carbon.</li></ul>";KAPSARC Publications; gasoline,  oil , Oil Price , workshop series ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-04-20T13:22:13+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:25+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/KS-1627-WB026A-Substitutes-for-Liquid-Fuels-Outlook-in-a-Low-Oil-Price-Environment11.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2016-04-20;2016-04-20;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the-impact-of-low-oil-and-gas-prices-on-gas-markets-a-retrospective-look-at-2014;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;The Impact of Low Oil and Gas Prices on Gas Markets: A Retrospective Look at 2014-15;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">KAPSARC is analyzing the shifting dynamics of the global gas markets. Global gas markets have turned upside down during the past five years: North America has emerged as a large potential future LNG exporter while gas demand growth has been slowing down as natural gas gets squeezed between coal and renewables. While the coming years will witness the fastest LNG export capacity expansion ever seen, many questions are raised on the next generation of LNG supply, the impact of low oil and gas prices on supply and demand patterns and how pricing and contractual structure may be affected by both the arrival of U.S. LNG on global gas markets and the desire of Asian buyers for cheaper gas.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>In the past year, global gas prices have dropped significantly, albeit at unequal paces depending on the region. All else being equal, economists would suggest that this should have generated a positive demand response. However, “all else” was not equal. Prices of other commodities also declined while economic growth forecasts were downgraded. </p><p>Prices at benchmark points such as the U.K. National Balancing Point (NBP), U.S. Henry Hub (HH) and Japan/Korea Marker (JKM) slumped due to lower oil prices, liquefied natural gas (LNG) oversupply and unseasonal weather. Yet, the prices of natural gas in local currencies have increased in a number of developing countries in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, former Soviet Union (FSU) and Asia. </p><p>North America experienced demand growth while gas in Europe and Asia faced rising competition from cheaper coal, renewables and, in some instances, nuclear. Gains to European demand were mostly weather related while increases in Africa and Latin America were not significant. </p><p>For LNG, Europe became the market of last resort as Asian consumption declined. Moreover, an anticipated surge in LNG supply, brought on by several new projects, may lead to a confrontation with Russian or other pipeline gas suppliers to Europe. At the same time, Asian buyers are seeking concessions on pricing and flexibility in their long-term contracts.</p><p> Looking ahead, natural gas has to prove itself a credible and affordable alternative to coal, notably in Asia, if the world is to reach its climate change targets. The future of the gas industry will also depend on oil prices, evolution of Chinese energy demand and impact of COP21 on national energy policies. Current low prices mean there is likely to be a pause in final investment decisions (FIDs) on LNG projects in the coming years.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Gas Markets,  oil and gas prices,  impact of lower prices;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-05-03T13:22:13+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:25+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KS-1634-DP028-The-Impact-of-Low-Oil-and-Gas-Prices-on-Gas-Markets-A-Retrospective-Look-at-2014-15_1-5-16web1.pdf;0;Anne-Sophie Corbeau, Rami Shabaneh, Sammy Six;;;;;;;2016-05-03;2016-05-03;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
lng-markets-in-transition-the-great-reconfiguration;;;;Saudi Arabia;EMEA;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;LNG Markets in Transition: The Great Reconfiguration;<p>	<strong>About the Project: </strong></p><p>	The paper will analyze the challenges posed by the present business environment to the LNG industry as of 2016 and explore potential ways forward in terms of pricing and long-term contracts. Substantial amounts of LNG supply will reach the market by 2020 that may well exceed Asia’s appetite for LNG, which had relied mostly on increasing demand from China, India and Southeast Asia, presenting uncertainties in terms of growth due to price sensitivity. The flexibility of some new supplies, notably from the United States, means that many companies may be left with large amounts of surplus LNG. In this context, Europe is widely seen as the residual market where additional volume could be sold but its absorption capacity is likely to be tested by resistance from pipeline suppliers, especially Russia. Could this trigger another shift in LNG business with sellers of either existing supplies having to renegotiate or new projects moving ahead without the support of long-term contracts?</p><p>	<strong>Key Points:</strong></p><ul><li>Spot and short-term LNG trade are expected to continue rising, potentially reaching 45 percent of global LNG trade by 2020. Increased supply side flexibility is already embedded in higher volumes of uncommitted LNG, portfolio LNG, and US LNG that is not destination bound.</li>	<li>Looking at the next five years, many factors point to a change in the way the LNG market operates. Individually, these factors would not trigger massive changes, but together, they could create a great reconfiguration of the LNG business. 	</li><li>The growth of short-term trade is important because it will determine the future relevance of spot-indexed prices and buyer’s need for long-term contractual LNG volumes.</li><li>A change in the nature of buyers from government monopoly or utilities in OECD countries to include smaller players, independent power producers and traders seeking to profit from arbitrage opportunities. Meanwhile, established incumbents had to change their business models, as their market share was no longer guaranteed and stable markets saw greater volatility in gas demand.</li></ul>;KAPSARC Publications;Discussion Paper, LNG, Coal, Renewables, Power Generation;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-05-04T10:00:58+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:24+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/LNG-Markets-in-Transition_A-Corbeau-and-D-Ledesma.pdf;0;Anne-Sophie Corbeau;;;;;;;2016-05-04;2016-05-04;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;Oxford Institute for Energy Studies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

renewable-energy-lessons-from-the-eu-experience;;;;Europe;EMEA;;;;;;;;Renewable Energy: Lessons from the EU Experience;<p><strong>About the Project </strong></p><p>Recognizing the limitations of common metrics for measuring how renewable energy should be incentivized and how its impact should be measured, the project on renewable energy in the European Union grows out of our academic research into calculating the direct and indirect costs of the various incentive schemes found in the United Kingdom and Europe. Noting that the fluctuating output of renewable energy, at incentivized prices, under dispatch priority creates a cost for conventional generators forced to reduce capacity and reprioritize their plant, we introduce financial option theory to measure the burden upon conventional fossil fuel in hedging against the consequent exposure. The option analytic model was first applied to data for the United Kingdom before being used upon the major countries of the European Union, yielding similar results. As detailed in our research, according to the metric return on capital employed, renewable energy support schemes produced generous rewards with little risks to private investors at a time when Europe’s major energy utilities were earning less than their cost of capital. Using financial option method, we are able to calculate the indirect costs of renewable energy upon incumbents in managing random renewable output under dispatch priority, and find it to be very expensive. The key outcome of this project is showing the economic inefficiency of the European Union support schemes for renewable energy. For the U.K. and the rest of Europe, the indirect costs imposed upon incumbent utilities and generators in accepting the output from renewable energy generators were significant with burdens falling upon all stakeholders.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;Publications, Renewables;;en;;2016-05-16T13:22:12+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:24+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/KS-1636-DP030-Renewable-Energy-Lessons-from-the-EU-Experience.pdf;0;Lawrence Haar;;;;;;;2016-05-16;2016-05-16;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;ANNUALLY;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

	<strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<div>
	The transportation sector accounts for about 25 percent of all energy consumed worldwide and light duty vehicles constitute the largest portion of this. The policy has a significant role in increasing vehicle fuel efficiency and expanding the reach of alternatively fueled vehicles.
</div><br/>
<div>
	Many government policies are currently in place to promote greater vehicle fuel efficiency and market penetration of alternative fuel vehicles, especially electric vehicles.
</div><br/>
<div>
	Nonetheless, light-duty electric vehicle sales remain modest in major markets such as China and the United States, where they have reached just 1 percent of total new vehicle sales. In contrast, policies in Norway have led to a 14 percent new vehicle market share for electric vehicles.
	<br/>
</div><br/>
<div>
	Replicating successful Norwegian policies in other countries could prove challenging, as there are impediments to significant future electric vehicle penetration in those markets, such as competing long-term fiscal commitments and increasing fuel efficiency by existing internal combustion engine technology

<strong></strong><div><strong>Key Points:<br/><br/></strong>The recent fall in oil and natural gas revenues has brought renewed attention to domestic energy pricing issues among GCC governments. Fuel and feedstock prices are typically set below world market prices to support domestic energy-intensive activities such as petrochemicals production. GCC members can explore different pathways for reforming energy prices, as demonstrated by the successes in Dubai and Tunisia. Such reforms result in more efficient production and consumption of energy and a positive contribution to a nation’s finances. </div><ul><li>To remain competitive in the global market, domestic energy-intensive industries – such as petrochemicals – have long benefited from government subsidies in the form of low natural gas prices. </li><li>Trading natural gas among GCC countries could bring joint gains while allowing the petrochemical industry to maintain its competitiveness.  </li></ul><ul><li>Although pricing distortions in domestic markets create obstacles to determining fair trading prices between countries, the power generation sector could gain tremendously from electricity trading, especially since an interconnected network is already in place. </li></ul>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop series, Energy Systems Modeling;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-06-13T09:54:00+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:22+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/KS-1629-WB028A-Opportunities-and-Challenges-in-Reforming-Energy-Prices-in-GCC-Countries.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2016-06-13;2016-06-13;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Many factors can produce conflicting energy productivity estimates, all of which are systematically examined in this study. This project is part of a larger body of KAPSARC research analyzing energy demand, energy efficiency and rebound.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>The existence of multiple approaches to calculating energy productivity, with its resulting diverse outcomes, makes it difficult to draw meaningful comparisons between economies and monitor their progress over time. To understand better the implications of this, we conducted a systematic in-depth survey of the various approaches. </p><p>Our analysis showed that calculated energy productivity could vary vastly depending on the assumptions used in the accounting of renewables, international marine bunkering and traditional biomass. We illustrate this divergence based on three of the most commonly used global energy databases. </p><p>When measuring gross domestic product, whether market or purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates are used will have an impact, especially on developing economies. The lack of timely PPP exchange rates adds to the complications. Furthermore, for large oil exporters, the way real GDP is measured can affect the evolution of their energy productivity. </p><p>We see a need for a greater degree of standardization in the energy economics community on the matters we have raised.

We focus on most popular instruments such as feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums and investment credits. These policy instruments have a different impact on private investor’s behavior, resulting in different levels deployment of renewable technology, different speeds of adoption and different costs to taxpayers and ratepayers. The objective is to understand how private investors make decisions on renewable energy to help policymakers to choose the best policy to achieve their objectives.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>Policymakers have a variety of financial tools to foster the deployment of renewables. Our study explores how these policy instruments impact a private investor’s behavior, and the resulting differences in the adoption of renewable technology as well as costs to taxpayers and ratepayers. </p><p>Success of a renewable support scheme is typically measured by the cost involved, amount of chosen technology deployed, and speed of adoption. </p><p>All policy instruments (including feed-in tariffs, feed-in premiums and investment credits) can be designed to achieve the same amount of total renewable technology deployment. But each is likely to have a distinct societal cost, which is allocated differently between taxpayers and ratepayers. </p><p>Investment credit is the cheapest policy option for taxpayers because renewable technologies are capital intensive. However, if the objective is to expedite the maximum deployment of renewables in a short period of time, without regard to costs, then a contract-for-difference feed-in tariff is the preferred instrument. </p><p>We found that cheap loans increase the expected profits for private investors and also lead to slower adoption because it gives investors an incentive to wait. Finally, there are doubts over the common perception that investors prefer feed-in tariffs over investment credits and feed-in premiums due to the lower risks inherent in the former.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;FIT, feed-in tariff, FIP, feed-in premiums, IC, investment credits;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-06-16T07:00:27+00:00;;;2017-02-06T13:02:57+00:00;2018-11-21T07:02:22+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/KS-1639-DP033A-Policy-Instruments-and-Market-Uncertainty-Exploring-the-Impact-on-Renewables-Adoption_sg.pdf;0;Jorge Blazquez, Nora Nezamuddin, Tamim Zamrik;;;;;;;2016-06-16;2016-06-16;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

designing-electricity-markets-to-integrate-renewable-energy;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Designing Electricity Markets to Integrate Renewable Energy;<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p><p>The goal of this project is to understand how policy can expedite renewable energy transitions in a cost-effective way, while allowing competitive national industries to develop. In line with this objective, a wide range of policy instruments, designed and implemented to promote renewable energy, are being assessed. Furthermore, the project takes a holistic approach by analyzing how the competitive dynamics between renewable technologies and incumbent technologies evolve. The workshop series, in line with KAPSARC’s overall mission, fits into the overall project by providing a space for dialogue, collaboration, feedback on current work, and setting future research directions.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>The penetration of renewable energy in deregulated electricity markets is changing the behavior of wholesale electricity prices. Liberalized electricity markets work well when the penetration of renewable energy is low, but they are disrupted when the penetration is significant. </p><p>Renewable technologies have a cost structure that disrupts the traditional formation of wholesale electricity prices in liberalized markets — they have zero or near zero marginal costs. </p><p>In Europe, the decline in electricity prices is due to the extent of renewable energy deployment. These lower prices are artificial as the true cost of electricity is much higher, especially once public subsidies are taken into account. </p><p>The poor design of liberalized electricity markets is the cause of two inconsistencies: </p><p>• Although renewable energy results in lower prices, this is not the result of a decline in long-run full-cycle costs. • The returns earned by renewable energy arise from the marginal costs set by fossil fuel technologies. Therefore, if fossil fuels were displaced from the market, current liberalized market rules would deny these returns. </p><p>Policymakers and market participants are still searching for a ‘best’ design, which facilitates the integration of renewable energy into the power market — a fertile area for future research.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;Workshop series;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-06-16T13:22:10+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:21+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/KS-1630-WB029A-Designing-Electricity-Markets-to-Integrate-Renewable-Energy.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2016-06-16;2016-06-16;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Understanding the impact of various factors that affect adoption rates, such as: (i) consumer related factors – demographics, behavioral, psychographics; (ii) regulatory factors – policies, incentives, rebates, perks; and (iii) geo-temporal factors – weather, infrastructure, network effects; forms the backbone of KAPSARC’s efforts in the transportation field. Our team is currently developing models at different levels of resolution – micro level models using large-scale data comprising of new car buyers’ profiles and macro level models using aggregated adoption data, to understand and project the effects of various factors at play for the adoption of energy-efficient vehicles.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p> adoption of energy-efficient technologies is a key factor in improving energy utilization. The ways in which consumers make their decisions – incorporating non-economic factors – is critical to understanding the pace and depth of adoption. We present a way of characterizing current and potential adopters of new technology and the factors that influence their decisions using battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption in the U.S. as a case study. </p><ul><li>BEVs have the potential to secure up to ⁓2.4 percent of the U.S. automotive market. </li><li>The costs of adding the features that potential BEV buyers require to change their purchase decisions, combined with the eventual removal of purchase subsidies, will likely offset the forecasted declines in battery costs. </li><li>The biggest competitors to BEVs are fuel-efficient gasoline vehicles.

North America has emerged as a large potential future LNG exporter while gas demand growth has been slowing down as natural gas gets squeezed between coal and renewables. While the coming years will witness the fastest LNG export capacity expansion ever seen, many questions are raised on the next generation of LNG supply, the impact of low oil and gas prices on supply and demand patterns and how pricing and contractual structure may be affected by both the arrival of U.S. LNG on global gas markets and the desire of Asian buyers for cheaper gas</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>Around 150 mtpa of LNG export capacity will come to global gas markets over 2015-20. While Asia seems unlikely now to be able to absorb it all, Europe emerges as a residual market for flexible volumes. The question is, therefore, which outcome(s) in the global LNG market could set the stage for a battle for market share in the European gas market between LNG suppliers and the incumbent pipeline suppliers, most importantly Russia, and how that country could respond to the potential challenge of large quantities of LNG supplies flooding European gas markets? </p><ul><li>Russia’s gas export strategy in Europe so far has been based on value maximization rather than on protecting its market share. But if increasing LNG supply to Europe becomes an extended threat to Russia’s market share, it may change its position from reactive to proactive and attempt to defend it. </li><li>Whether a confrontation between Russian gas and LNG takes place and how Russia could respond depends crucially on the build-up of total LNG trade and the appetite of China for LNG. </li><li>Russia has the advantage of being a low cost producer with ample spare productive capacity and underutilized pipeline capacity to Europe. A low price environment (up to $40/bbl) would actually benefit Russia more than a higher price environment, from a market share perspective, as it can reduce its prices below the variable costs of U.S. LNG and can push U.S. volumes out of the European market. In a higher price environment, U.S. LNG would continue to flow. </li><li>The competition between Russian gas and U.S. LNG in Europe is also about pricing models, driven on one hand by oil market fundamentals, with some influence from Europe spot markets, and on the other hand driven by the fundamentals of the U.S. gas market and the LNG trade. </li><li>The geopolitical aspect is also important. While relations between Russia and Europe have become frosty, cheap and abundant Russian gas could potentially help mend commercial ties. However, the tensions between the U.S. and Russia have been increased by the Ukraine situation, the war in Syria and sanctions. The competition between U.S. LNG and Russian pipeline gas in Europe is about more than the pure commercial aspects and will be influenced by the geopolitical standoff of the two powers.</li></ul>;KAPSARC Publications;Pipeline Gas,  LNG, Discussion paper ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-07-26T07:00:26+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:21+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/KS-1643-DP037A-Will-There-be-a-Price-War-Between-Russian-Pipeline-Gas-and-US-LNG-in-Europe.pdf;0;Anne-Sophie Corbeau, Vitaly Yermakov;;;;;;;2016-07-26;2016-07-26;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<strong>About the Project:</strong></p><p>
	We developed the KAPSARC Energy Model for Saudi Arabia (KEM-SA) to understand
the dynamics of the country’s energy system. It is a partial equilibrium model formulated
as a mixed complementarity problem to capture the administered prices that permeate
the local economy. KEM-SA has been previously used to study the impacts of various
industrial fuel pricing policies and improved residential efficiency on the energy
economy. The passenger transportation model presented in this paper helps understand
more of the end-use energy demand, and it is being integrated into KEM-SA.</p><p>
	<strong>Key Points:</strong></p><p>
	Empirical estimates of fuel demand changes to price variation are based on historical consumption
and prices, and can be applied as a single point estimate to a wide range of price movements.
However, if fuel prices are set outside the boundaries of historical changes, policymakers may be
concerned as to the validity of the empirically assessed price elasticity. We have developed a transport
model to provide a techno-economic estimate of the price elasticity of fuel demand. It incorporates
consumers’ choices as a result of several factors, including fuel substitutes, available transport modes,
income, value of time and magnitude of price change</p><ul>
	
<li>Our findings from the application of this transport model to Saudi Arabia show that policymakers can
have confidence that the empirical estimates are broadly valid, even for large changes and if prices
move outside historical variations. 
	</li>	
<li>In general, gasoline demand in Saudi Arabia is price inelastic due to the lack of fuel and modal
substitutes. However, our approach suggests that the response may become more pronounced
when the magnitude of the change increases. 
	</li>	
<li>The cross-price elasticity of diesel is not constant. Demand for diesel will increase if gasoline price is
raised significantly. Motorists may, for example, opt for diesel-based public transport, such as trains
or buses, for long distance local trips. The change in jet-fuel use is negligible.

the-expectations-of-stakeholders-in-eastern-africas-oil-and-gas;;;;Africa;EMEA;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;The Expectations of Stakeholders in Eastern Africa’s Oil and Gas;"<p><strong>About the Project<br/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our project is titled Energy Development in New Producing Countries and seeks to understand how natural resource development can achieve inclusive economic growth through the localization of economic activities. We are engaged in a multiyear, multi-disciplinary study with three objectives: </p><ul> <li>Assess the direct fiscal impact and trade-offs of policy choices.</li><li>Understand how industry can be localized to create economic growth.</li><li>Estimate spillovers and welfare impacts to society. </li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our initial focus is on four countries – Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda – that expect to develop significant oil and gas reserves in the next 5-7 years. Through natural resource development, these countries hope to achieve middle-income economic status by 2030-2040.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><strong>Key Points<br/></strong></p><p>Local content is a political imperative in Eastern Africa, and how it is implemented has implications for the economics of oil and gas projects and could also affect expected government revenues. Policymakers need to weigh the trade-off between encouraging local content against endangering the viability of a project by loading it with ill-equipped, untrained or costly local options. Highlights from a KAPSARC workshop on this issue include: </p><ul>
<li>Stakeholder expectations about local content should be tempered by an understanding of the size of the reserves and the development plans under consideration.</li></ul><ul>
<li>For most new-producing countries, the opportunity to create meaningful local content is front-loaded in the value chain; primarily in the upstream activities. This is a significant point in Eastern Africa because the time needed for workforce and SME development will exceed the CAPEX phase of many upstream projects. Consequently, the promise of midstream and downstream local content would have missed the opportunity.</li></ul><ul>
<li>Getting the expectations of stakeholders “right” will help maintain the social license to operate. One of the simplest ways to do this is to begin discussions, in real terms, on what an individual or family can expect in gains in welfare from the windfall revenues that will go to the government.</li></ul><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>";KAPSARC Publications;oil and  gas reserves, local content, oil and gas prices, Workshop Series;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-08-09T13:22:09+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:21+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/KS-1633-WB032A-The-Expectations-of-Stakeholders-in-Eastern-Africas-Oil-and-Gas.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2016-08-09;2016-08-09;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

new-business-and-regulatory-models-for-utilities-of-the-future;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;New Business and Regulatory Models for Utilities of the Future;<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p><p> The Utilities of the Future project focuses on how new technologies in distributed energy resources (DER) are transforming customer/provider relationships. Advances in distributed generation technologies and associated cost reductions are providing customers with potentially attractive alternatives to standard electric utility services, perhaps turning them into ‘prosumers’. Utilities around the world are re-evaluating their business models, and regulators are considering multiple market reforms. The project aims to develop analytical tools and techniques to help address the key market, regulatory and energy policy issues in a power sector with high penetration of DER.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>Technological advancements have the potential to disrupt the fundamentals of the electric power sector and to some extent make the current role of utilities obsolete. Many countries face this challenge but so far a generic business and regulatory model has yet to emerge that would resolve this issue. New technologies could result in two market altering outcomes, which the industry and regulators cannot ignore:</p><ul><li>First, the penetration of distributed energy resources (DER) could lead to policies becoming increasingly local and the power sector being more fragmented, both in its value chain and services traded. </li><li>Second, the value chain can be unbundled further by creating a platform, potentially operated by the utility, where new products and services are traded. </li><li>The challenge for regulators is to create functional markets, which can handle unbundled services, prevent technological lock-in and protect the vulnerable.</li></ul>;KAPSARC Publications; distributed energy resources , DER, Workshop series ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-08-10T13:22:08+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:20+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/KS-1631-WB030A-New-Business-and-Regulatory-Models-for-Utilities-of-the-Future.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2016-08-10;2016-08-10;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Global gas markets have turned upside down during the past five years: North America has emerged as a large potential future LNG exporter while gas demand growth has been slowing down as natural gas gets squeezed between coal and renewables. While the coming years will witness the fastest LNG export capacity expansion ever seen, many questions are raised on the next generation of LNG supply, the impact of low oil and gas prices on supply and demand patterns and how pricing and contractual structure may be affected by both the arrival of U.S. LNG on global gas markets and the desire of Asian buyers for cheaper gas</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>This paper provides a comprehensive worldwide database of estimated elasticities for electricity and natural gas for households as a function of income, price, capital stocks and weather conditions.</p><ul><li>Emerging economies show lower price elasticities than advanced economies as a result of limited physical capital availability and lock in effect pertaining to energy consumption. </li><li>Hot weather has a higher impact on energy demand in emerging economies than in advanced ones, as a result of higher efficiency and diversified technologically-advanced equipment. </li><li>We find that the energy demand elasticity to capital stock is positive implying that the rebound effect prevails over the substitution effect when it comes to the deployment of capital stock technologies.</li><li>For most countries, including former Soviet Union economies, natural gas is considered as an essential good while electricity is perceived, economically, as a luxury where its income elasticity is above unity</li></ul>;KAPSARC Publications;LNG, Discussion paper , households , capital stocks;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-08-10T13:22:08+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:19+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/KS-1644-DP038A-Quantifying-Worldwide-Demand-Elasticities-as-a-Policy-Tool.pdf;0;Tarek Atallah, Carlo Andrea Bollino, Simona Bigerna;;;;;;;2016-08-10;2016-08-10;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

potential-gains-from-reforming-price-caps-in-chinas-power-sector;;;;China;APAC;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Potential Gains From Reforming Price Caps in China’s Power Sector;<p><strong>About the Project </strong></p><p>The KAPSARC Energy Model of China (KEM China) project began in 2014 to study energy and environmental issues in China. KEM China has been developed to understand China’s energy economy and fuel mix, how they are impacted by government intervention, as well as their interaction with global markets. It is a modular integrated mixed-complementarity problem model that optimizes supply decisions, minimizing fuel and technology costs, while taking into account the effect of government regulation on prices and the environment.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p><strong></strong>When energy sectors transition from government-controlled to market-driven systems, the legacy regulatory instruments can create unintended market distortions and lead to higher costs. In China, the most notable regulatory throwback is ceilings on electricity prices that generators can charge utilities, which are specified by plant type and region. We built a mixed complementarity model calibrated to 2012 data to examine the impact of these price caps on the electricity and coal sectors. Our study highlights the following major findings: </p><ul><li>Capped on-grid tariffs incentivize market concentration and vertical integration so that generators can cross-subsidize power plants, ensure an uninterrupted supply of fuel and reduce the impact of volatility in fuel prices. </li><li>Tight price caps can cause the system to deviate from the least-cost capacity and fuel mix. In 2012, this resulted in an additional annual cost of at least 45 billion RMB, or 4 percent of China’s total power system cost. The government also had to subsidize some of the losses, which indicates that this regulatory design is not responsive to market realities. </li><li>Price constraints can impact the outcomes of other policy initiatives causing them to veer from intended goals. In the case of China, according to our modeling, greater installed wind capacity does not have a significant impact on the amount of coal consumed. Also, abolishing restrictive tariff caps on coal-fired generation does not increase coal use because the utilization rate of peak-shaving coal plants drops. </li><li>We also estimate, using the model, subsidies required for a range of wind capacity additions to China’s power generation mix and find that the feed-in tariff could have been less generous.</li></ul>;KAPSARC Publications;KEM China, prices, Discussion paper ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-09-28T13:22:07+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:18+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/KS-1652-DP047-Potential-Gains-from-Reforming-Price-Caps-in-Chinas-Power-Sector.pdf;0;Bertrand Williams Rioux, Philipp Galkin, Axel Pierru, Frederic Murphy;;;;;;;2016-09-29;2016-09-29;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
investing-for-energy-productivity-in-the-gcc-financing-the-transition;;;;Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates;EMEA;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Investing for Energy Productivity in the GCC – Financing the Transition;"<p>
<strong>Key Points:</strong></p><p>An unprecedented infrastructure investment boom occurred in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
in the first part of the 21st century. Strong public capital spending supported by high energy prices
provided governments with an opportunity to accelerate economic diversification and infrastructure
investment, lifting economic growth and per capita incomes. The 2014 collapse in oil prices created an
added impetus for a transition to a more sustainable growth model less dependent on volatile energy
markets. Here we make the case for a greater focus on energy productive investment to drive this transition.</p><p>Although evidence suggests that some GCC countries are beginning the transition to a more energy
productive investment paradigm, in other countries capital investment is not lifting energy productivity.
Particular progress has been made in recent years in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Qatar has
experienced the strongest growth in infrastructure investment (in percentage terms), but in recent years
its energy productivity has declined significantly. In Bahrain, a decline in capital investment has also
been accompanied by stagnation in its once-improving energy productivity. Oman remains strongly on
a low energy productivity growth path.</p><p>Given that GCC governments face a constrained fiscal environment and low domestic energy prices
remain for consumers, we suggest that policymakers consider a market-based 'negabarrel' program to
stimulate energy productivity investment. Such a program would commoditize the value of avoided energy
consumption and could provide social benefits in terms of extra energy available to export and avoided
capital expenditure on new electricity generation capacity. This value is currently not available to the
private sector and low prices provide weak incentives for the private sector to invest in energy productivity. </p><p>A 'negabarrel' program on the scale of around USD 100 billion across the GCC implemented over 10
years could incentivize private sector investment, generate around 800,000 to 1.2 million new jobs and
increase government revenue, if a robust energy service company (ESCO) market can be established.
Implementation programs, such as super ESCOs, need careful planning, but can deliver substantial
economic benefits and employment opportunities for GCC citizens in the area of energy auditing and
management.</p><p>Even in a low oil price environment there are significant opportunities to improve energy productivity in
a cost-effective way across the GCC economies and the potential national benefits should make this
an investment priority. Within Saudi Arabia improving energy productivity can sit well within the 2030
vision direction. Recent increases in end-user energy prices across the GCC, have shifted the balance
of benefits more towards the energy user but joint public-private sector actions will still be required to
catalyze the required actions</p><p>Other financing options to support the transition to higher energy productivity include incorporating
energy productivity criteria into existing public capital spending; establishing a new public financing
vehicle specifically for energy productivity investment; and issuing energy productivity 'green' bonds,
including Green Sukuk.</p><p>As for all investments, the risks of energy productivity investment are real, but so too are the benefits
for citizens, businesses and governments. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;Energy Productivity, Publications;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-10-02T07:51:46+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:18+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KS-1647-DP042A-Investing-for-Productivity-in-the-GCC-Financing-the-Transition.pdf;0;Kankana Dubey, Steven Fawkes, Nicholas Howarth, Moncef Krarti, Padu S.

The project’s objective is to understand what are the macroeconomic fundamentals that increase the resilience of a country to energy shocks and, in particular, the role of the energy mix in reducing vulnerability. The research will be complemented by an analysis of policies that enhance the resilience of economies to energy shocks.</p><p><strong>Key Points<br/></strong></p><p>Understanding how the composition of a country’s energy mix is formed in an environment where greater government involvement is anticipated due to climate change obligations is critical. This paper is part of a project analyzing drivers of the mix and the transition to a future energy mix where renewables will have a key role. This initial study considers the fossil fuel mix in the U.S., Germany and the U.K. by undertaking a macroeconomic analysis of the importance of prices relative to policy in shaping the mix for these economies over the last 35 years.</p><ul>
<li>U.S. fossil fuel mix has been primarily driven by market forces and relative prices since the early 1980s. In Germany and the U.K., on the other hand, the mix was primarily shaped by policy until the 1990s; and by relative prices thereafter as structural changes initiated a move toward liberalizing power generation markets.</li></ul><ul>
<li>The transition from coal to gas in Germany and the U.K. increased macroeconomic volatility since the price of natural gas is more volatile than that of coal and, thus, transfered this higher volatility to economic activity.</li></ul><ul>
<li>German and U.K. policies have resulted in a ‘cleaner’ fuel mix, but this transition was not initiated by a climate change agenda, it was the result of pro-market policies. However, Europe is now in a new energy transition’ era with a move to increase significantly the proportion of renewables via command policies and financial incentives–thus, moving the evolution of the energy mix away from a pure market equilibrium. </li></ul><p><strong></strong></p>";KAPSARC Publications;fossil fuel, DSGE, Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium, energy mix, energy transitions, Discussion Paper;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-10-05T13:22:06+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:17+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KS-1649-DP044A-Prices-Versus-Policy-An-Analysis-of-the-Drivers-of-the-Fossil-Fuel-Energy-Mix.pdf;0;Tarek Atalla, Jorge Balzquez, Lester C.

	<strong>Key Points:</strong></p><p>The U.S. light-duty vehicle market represents a key test bed for some of the world’s leading vehicle regulatory policy programs. At the federal level, standards for model years 2022-2025 were established in 2012 under the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions/Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program. At the state level, the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate portion of California’s Advanced Clean Cars program, adopted by nine other states, was most recently revised at about the same time. Although both are emissions-related policies, they are concerned with different time frames and aspects of the vehicle market. The forthcoming mid-term review for both programs presents an ideal opportunity to reassess likely outcomes in light of new information and changing market conditions and to align them with policy expectations.</p><p>Perhaps the single biggest change since 2012 is the unexpected drop in fuel prices. Low fuel prices imply low fuel cost savings, which reduces the incentive for consumers to pay up front for fuel efficient technologies. This could shorten the time horizon under which meeting GHG/CAFE standards via technology improvements is economically feasible.</p><p>The ZEV mandate currently straddles the line between an innovation policy and a technology-forcing policy. The near-term goal is to foster innovation and introduction of ZEV technologies in a way that accelerates both cost reduction and consumer familiarity, while the long-term goal is to achieve extensive GHG reductions.</p><p>GHG/CAFE and ZEV place different types of requirements on manufacturers simultaneously. It is worth exploring whether their goals could be achieved through a single, unified policy, given the ultimate goal of cost-effective GHG reduction over the longer term.

Specific attention is placed on how energy is used to meet water demand in both water scarce and water abundant countries. Other issues of importance include how water and energy are mobilized for food production and better policies for transboundrial governance of water and energy resources.</p><p><strong>Key Points<br/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As economies in the Middle East and Asia grow and develop, there will be further strain on water, energy and food resources – each inextricably linked to the others. Much of the Middle East is energy abundant, but population growth and economic development have led to severe water and food scarcity. In Asia, despite a comparative abundance of water, energy and food, the problem is increasingly one of economic scarcity – the inability to finance the mobilization of these vital resources.</p><ul><li>Water for agriculture: There is not enough robust data on the inter dependencies of water, energy and food. There is an opportunity to improve data collection so that proper economic, environmental and social impact assessments can be performed before policy decisions for resource management are made.</li></ul><ul><li>Transboundary governance: Water basins do not respect national boundaries, making their management more difficult. When conflicts occur, bottom up solutions such as cooperation for sub-basin management can provide a platform for international water management. Examples of successful transboundary governance can be found in the Mekong River delta and Nile River basin.</li></ul><ul><li>Infrastructure financing: In Asia, securing the least cost water and energy utility provision option is important, given financial constraints. The ‘pro-poor public-private partnerships’ (5P) experience is one approach that attempts to harmonize private sector efficiency with public sector development goals.</li></ul><ul><li>Coordination: Energy and water infrastructure projects are not always considered as a package, for example cooling water for power plants. An integrated planning process can improve coordination among different institutions and result in more resilient and sustainable infrastructure investments.</li></ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p>";KAPSARC Publications;food suplies, Mobilizing water, Mobilizing energy, Water Resources , coordinating water-energy-food  policies, Workshop Series;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-10-16T13:22:05+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:16+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KS-1634-WB033A-Emerging-issues-facing-the-water-energy-food-nexus-in-the-middle-east-and-asia.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2016-10-16;2016-10-16;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;UNESCWA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This analysis can be used as part of an evidence base for setting nationally-appropriate energy productivity targets.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The need for this research is motivated by recent volatility in oil markets, which has spurred an urgency among GCC policy makers to find a new growth model that reduces their dependence on oil and gas, currently accounting for between 60 to 90 percent of government revenue. Some effort has been made toward this goal, primarily through diversification and energy efficiency, but with low domestic energy prices a strong feature of GCC markets, whether meaningful progress is being achieved warrants closer attention. To assess this, energy productivity offers a useful metric and strong policy narrative. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">To support this process, this paper applies an energy productivity Kuznets curve analysis for the GCC and compares this with G-7 countries and Australia. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The group of advanced economies investigated shows strong evidence of having successfully decoupled economic growth from per-capita energy consumption – even as per capita incomes rose.

It is the first general equilibrium model with overlapping generations to be developed and applied for energy policy analysis in the Arabian Peninsula. The version presented here is parameterized on Saudi data. It is a new and thoroughly revised version of the model developed for western countries by Gonand and Jouvet (2015). It is designed specifically for the economies of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, particularly insofar as it incorporates an oil-exporting sector and public finances benefiting massively and directly from oil exports.  </div>
<div>Its range of applications goes from modeling the impact on growth and inter-generational equity of  higher energy efficiency, to the assessment of the effects of different potential fuel mixes and/or end-use energy prices on long-term growth and welfare </div><p>distribution by age cohort. The MEGIR-SA model is also well suited to being adapted to include a sovereign wealth fund or for other oil exporting countries. The main advantage of MEGIR-SA is its ability to analyze precisely and simultaneously the effect of energy policies on potential growth and on intergenerational equity. This has some unavoidable cost in terms of modeling other aspects of the economy – e.g., the modeling of the supply side is more simplified than in models incorporating input-output matrix.  </p><div>This paper provides the detailed technical description of the model that is used in other, companion, policy-oriented, KAPSARC papers.

Accordingly, they also redistribute income across generations over long periods. In this paper, we use MEGIR-SA to assess the aggregate effects of higher energy efficiency in Saudi Arabia. </p><p>The model MEGIR-SA – Model with Energy, Growth and Intergenerational Redistribution-Saudi Arabia – is designed to assess the quantitative effects on growth and welfare across generations of different energy policies in Saudi Arabia – e.g., increasing end-use energy prices, fostering alternative energy mixes, bolstering energy efficiency and defining different levels of oil production over time while developing a sovereign wealth fund. </p><p>An annual increase of 4 percent in future energy efficiency would result by 2030 in 1 million barrels per day (bbl/d) of avoided domestic energy consumption and thus enable additional oil exports. Saudi oil income could increase by 50 billion Saudi Arabian Riyals (SAR) to 100 billion SAR per annum by 2030, depending on market conditions. If fully recycled through public current spending or investments, the upward effect on growth could be between 0.3 and 0.6 percent per year by 2030. Under pessimistic oil market and domestic oil production assumptions, our model suggests there would be a benefit in recycling additional oil revenues into public investments in infrastructures. </p><p>Most of the economic benefits of higher energy efficiency gains would accrue to individuals born after 1990 – who now account for more than half of the current Saudi population – or to future generations.

Among these benchmarks are a variety of breakeven points (also called breakeven costs or breakeven prices), which are widely used, and widely misunderstood. Misunderstandings have three origins: (1) There is no broadly accepted agreement on definitions; (2) for any given resource there is no universally applicable benchmark; (3) various breakeven points and other benchmarks are applicable at various times in the development of a resource. In this paper we clarify the purposes of several benchmarks and propose standardized definitions of them. We show how and why breakeven points are partitioned, and when each of the partitioned elements is appropriate to consider. We discuss in general terms the geological, geographical, and temporal factors that affect the benchmarks. We describe some other factors that contribute to the inelasticity of tight oil production. Finally, we explore macroeconomic and policy implications of a broader, more rigorous, and more consistent application of the breakeven point concept, and the understanding of the inelasticities that accompany it</p>";KAPSARC Publications;breakeven points, tight oil, cost of production,  production decline profiles, Discussion paper ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-11-01T13:22:07+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:19+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-012-Kleinberg-etal_MIT-Center_Hobbs.pdf;0;Robert L.

lng-for-africa;;;;Africa;EMEA;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;LNG for Africa;<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p><p>KAPSARC is analyzing the shifting dynamics of the global gas markets, which have turned upside down during the past five years. North America has emerged as a large potential future LNG exporter while gas demand growth has been slowing down as natural gas gets squeezed between coal and renewables. While the coming years will witness the fastest LNG export capacity expansion ever seen, many questions are raised on the next generation of LNG supply, the impact of low oil and gas prices on supply and demand patterns and how pricing and contractual structure may be affected by both the arrival of U.S. LNG on global gas markets and the desire of Asian buyers for cheaper gas.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>Though Africa is traditionally considered as an exporter of pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG), in future it could come to be seen as an LNG market. Until recently, financing issues, market conditions, price sensitivity and the small size of the individual gas markets were all strong deterrents to sellers looking at Africa as an LNG destination, even though the region’s per capita energy consumption is very low and there are hundreds of millions without electricity and modern cooking facilities. But now the situation has fundamentally changed because, faced with the slowdown in Asian LNG demand and a global LNG oversupply, sellers are looking for new markets. At the same time, LNG has become more affordable, more flexible and is increasingly sold on a spot basis. So now, gas can be part of the solution to developing Africa’s electricity generation, along with renewables. </p><p>Most African countries would need small initial volumes to feed the integrated LNG-to-power projects that sponsors are considering. This could lead to a further development of gas demand in other sectors as gas supply becomes available and infrastructure is developed. </p><p>The majority of countries are opting for floating storage and re-gasification units (FSRUs), enabling faster implementation. </p><p>The new markets could benefit from the proximity of existing African LNG suppliers, and future projects in Cameroon and Eastern Africa as suppliers optimize shipping distances. </p><p>The key issues of financing and the role of the state see investors looking for governments to provide regulatory and political clarity to prospective sellers, financial institutions to facilitate access to capital and LNG suppliers that will accept the risk of delivering to these new markets. The choice of pricing mechanism and contract commitment will be key for their viability. </p><p>The intended gas and power markets for these new LNG projects will only be developed if domestic gas and electricity buyers can secure their offtake liabilities and ability to pay for the energy to the satisfaction of lenders.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;LNG, Liquefied Natural Gas, Discussion paper;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-11-24T13:22:01+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:13+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KS-1658-DP052A-LNG-for-Africa.pdf;0;Anne-Sophie Corbeau;;;;;;;2016-11-24;2016-11-24;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
adding-photovoltaics-to-the-saudi-power-system;;;;Saudi Arabia;EMEA;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Adding Photovoltaics to the Saudi Power System;"<div><strong>Key Points:</strong><br/><br/>Intermittent generation from wind or photovoltaics (PV) imposes a cost on the power systems in which they are deployed. These costs vary regionally due to different fuel costs and ramping flexibility of existing grid capacities. With 2015 as a reference year, we examine the costs of PV intermittency and costs of integration to power utilities in Saudi Arabia, using a least-cost approach for the power utilities. The operational facets of PV integration to grid operators will be more pronounced with higher PV penetration, so, to focus on system operation, we exclude the capital costs. The excess of the price paid to new PV generators over the current average consumer tariff would also have to be covered by the utility, and will depend on the details of the power purchase contracts.  </div><ul>
<li>We define intermittency costs as the costs of ramping and maintaining spinning reserves. Integration costs are the sum of intermittency costs, plus the costs of grid upgrades that are needed when renewable deployment exceeds existing grid capacity. </li><li>The gross cost of intermittency, excluding any benefits attained from PV operation, rises to approximately 1.3 cents per kilowatt-hour (¢/kWh) of energy provided by PV when 20 GW of PV capacity are installed.  </li><li>At low levels of penetration, renewables may impose negligible cost or even confer net benefits. However, above a certain level, the costs will outweigh the benefits – what we term the ‘‘Operational Blend Wall.’’ </li><li>Adding up to 11 GW of PV generation capacity in some regions achieves lower system operating costs compared to a case without PV addition. Beyond 11 GW, costs begin to outweigh benefits, and the net cost to the power system increases by 0.04 ¢/kWh at 20 GW of PV deployment. This compares to an average cost of supply in the current power system of 1.61 ¢/kWh. </li><li>This operational blend wall of 11 GW is a function of overall system demand and the price of fuels displaced by PV electricity. If electricity prices were to rise to cover the integration costs, any resulting reduction in electricity use would reduce the blend wall. Similarly, increasing fuel prices would increase the blend wall.</li></ul><div><strong><br/>About the Project<br/><br/></strong></div>
 <div>We developed the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM) for Saudi Arabia to understand the dynamics of the country’s energy system. It is a partial equilibrium model formulated as a mixed complementarity problem to capture the administered prices that permeate the local economy. KEM for Saudi Arabia has been previously used to study the impacts of  various industrial fuel pricing policies, improved residential energy efficiency on the energy economy, and the feasibility of installing coal-fired power plants in Saudi Arabia. In the present paper, we use it to assess the intermittency and integration costs of photovoltaics in the Saudi power system. Ongoing work revolves around CO2 emissions in the cement  industry in KEM for Saudi Arabia, and generalizing the main results of this paper.</div>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion Paper;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-11-28T13:22:01+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:14+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/KS-1660-DP54A-Adding-Photovoltaics-to-the-Saudi-Power-System-What-are-the-Costs-of-Intermittency.pdf;0;Amro Elshurafa, Walid Matar;;;;;;;2016-11-28;2016-11-28;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Between June 2013 and June 2014, the report, which measures 189 economies worldwide, documented 230 business reforms, with 145 reforms aimed at reducing the complexity and cost of complying with business regulation, and 85 reforms aimed at strengthening legal institutions - with Sub-Saharan Africa accounting for the largest number of such reforms. Read about business reforms. Tajikistan, Benin, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Trinidad and Tobago, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Azerbaijan, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates are among the economies that improved the most in 2013/2014 in areas tracked by Doing Business. Together, these 10 top improvers implemented 40 regulatory reforms making it easier to do business. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 5 of the 10 top improvers in 2013/14. The region also accounts for the largest number of regulatory reforms making it easier to do business in the past year—75 of the 230 worldwide. More than 70% of its economies carried out at least one such reform. For the first time this year, Doing Business collected data for 2 cities in 11 economies with more than 100 million inhabitants. The economies are: Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, and the United States. The added city enables a subnational comparison and benchmarking against other large cities. Differences between cities are more common in indicators measuring the steps, time and cost to complete a standardized transaction where local agencies play a larger role, finds the report. Case studies highlighting good practices in 8 of the areas measured by Doing Business indicator sets are featured in the report: the growing efficiency of company registries in starting a business; zoning and urban planning in dealing with construction permits; measuring quality of land administration in registering property; importance of registries in getting credit; going beyond related-party transactions in protecting minority investors; trends before and after the financial crisis in paying taxes; judicial efficiency supporting freedom of contract in enforcing contracts; and measuring strength of insolvency laws in resolving insolvency. See all case studies. The report this year expands the data in three of the 10 topics covered, with further plans to expand on five topics in next year’s report. The Doing Business rankings are now based on a distance to the frontier measure. Each economy from the 189 economies measured is evaluated based on how close their business regulations are to the best global practices. A higher score indicates a more efficient business environment and stronger legal institutions.</p>";Economy, Trade;Regulatory, Efficiency, construction, permits, quality, rank, ease, eforce, contracts, credit, electricity, tax, investors, register, cost, start business;Public Domain;en;;2016-12-06T14:16:41+00:00;;;2018-09-27T12:09:10+00:00;2018-10-27T12:08:08+00:00;The World Bank;http://www.doingbusiness.org/data;34752;Doing Business Data;;;;;;;;;;;;;Annually;;2004 - 2017;Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;7

shaking-up-the-lng-scene;;;;World;WORLD;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Shaking up the LNG Scene;"<p><strong>Background to the Workshop</strong></p><p>KAPSARC’s Energy Workshop Series on natural gas started in March 2015. It aims at creating a collaborative space for discussion of the global trends and shifts in the global gas markets. The workshops bring together key stakeholders, including industry, consultants, policymakers, academics and financiers. This workshop is the third in the series and is largely dedicated to LNG markets. It also draws on the conclusions of the KAPSARC/OIES book LNG Markets in Transition: The Great Reconfiguration, which was published in September 2016 (Oxford University Press). Discussions were framed around future LNG markets, the uncertainties regarding future LNG supplies beyond the current LNG wave hitting gas markets and changes to the traditional LNG business model. Buyers and sellers are as far apart as they have ever been in terms of their aspirations and demands, leading some to question whether current price formation and contract mechanisms can emerge unscathed from the supply surge. Sellers claim that new projects cannot be sanctioned without the security of long-term, oil-indexed contracts. Buyers, facing significant demand uncertainties, are becoming more selective about the terms they accept.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><ul><li>Dramatic changes in the global liquified natural gas (LNG) markets are already visible through market dynamics and stakeholders’ behavior, but many other signs point to much more significant changes to come – a great reconfiguration, which could transform the way LNG is traded and have a farreaching impact on natural gas markets. </li><li>The structure, business models and market players in the LNG business are changing greatly, forcing existing players to be innovative to survive.</li><li>Sellers and lenders need to accept that moving to more risky business areas will be necessary for gas to expand its role, notably by bringing electric power and industrialization to energy poor regions. </li><li>The gas industry tends to focus primarily on the power sector; it should also exploit its advantages by promoting gas use in the industrial and transportation sectors. Heat production and air quality improvement are two areas where gas has an advantage. </li><li>As buyers ask for more changes on pricing and supply flexibility, sellers are concerned that contract sanctity may be at risk. This could create major issues in convincing traditional lenders to finance LNG projects.</li></ul>";KAPSARC Publications;LNG ,  liquified natural gas , Workshop series;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2016-12-08T13:22:01+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:13+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/KS-1660-WB054A-Shaking-up-the-LNG-Scene.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2016-12-08;2016-12-08;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The latest estimate for sub-Saharan Africa has been revised up by 22 million, illustrating how rapid population growth can continue to outpace the rate of electrification in many countries and conceal the progress that has been made.

Consumption data for coal, petroleum, and natural gas are multiplied by their respective thermal conversion factors, which are in units of heat energy per unit of fuel consumed (i.e., per cubic foot, barrel, or ton), to calculate the amount of heat energy derived from fuel combustion. Results are expressed in terms of heat energy obtained from each fuel type. These energy consumption data were multiplied by their respective carbon dioxide emission factors, which are called carbon content coefficients by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These factors quantify the mass of oxidized carbon per unit of energy released from a fuel. In the U.S.A., they are typically expressed in units of teragrams of carbon (Tg-C = 10^12 grams of carbon) per quadrillion British thermal units (quadrillion Btu = 10^15 Btu, or ""quad""), and are highest for coal and lowest for natural gas.

The themes and indicator tables were selected based on the current demands for international environmental statistics and the availability of internationally comparable data. Statistics on Water and Waste are based on official statistics supplied by national statistical offices and/or ministries of environment (or equivalent institutions) in response to the biennial UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire on Environment Statistics, complemented with comparable statistics from OECD and Eurostat, and water resources data from FAO Aquastat. Statistics on other themes were compiled by UNSD from other international sources. In a few cases, UNSD has made some calculations in order to derive the indicators. However, generally no adjustments have been made to the values received from the source. UNSD is not responsible for the quality, completeness/availability, and validity of the data. Environment statistics is still in an early stage of development in many countries, and data are often sparse.

It provides in-depth coverage of the main economic issues and the policy measures required to foster growth in each member country. Forthcoming developments in major non-OECD economies are also evaluated in detail. Each edition of the Outlook provides a unique resource to keep abreast of world economic developments. The OECD Economic Outlook database is a comprehensive and consistent macroeconomic database of the OECD economies, covering expenditures, foreign trade, output, labour markets, interest and exchange rates, balance of payments, and government debt. For the non-OECD regions, foreign trade and current account series are available. The database contains annual for the projection period. Variables are defined in such a way that they are as homogenous as possible for the countries covered. Breaks in underlying series are corrected as far as possible. Sources for the historical data are publications of national statistical agencies and OECD statistical publications such as the Quarterly National Accounts, the Annual National Accounts, the Labour Force Statistics and the Main Economic Indicators.

composite-leading-indicators-mei;2017-05-08;;Knoema;World;WORLD;http://www.oecd.org/termsandconditions/;Public;;;;;;Composite Leading Indicators (MEI);"CLIs are calculated for 33 OECD countries (Iceland is not included), 6 non-member economies and 8 zone aggregates. A country CLI comprises a set of component series selected from a wide range of key short-term economic indicators. CLIs, reference series data (see below) and standardised business and consumer confidence indicators are presented in various forms. For further information on interpretation and comparability of various form please refer to the presentation section of the OECD CLI methodology document: http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/41629509.pdf. The composite leading indicator is a times series, formed by aggregating a variety of component indicators which show a reasonably consistent relationship with a reference series (e.g. industrial production IIP up to March 2012 and since then the reference series is GDP) at turning points. The OECD CLI is designed to provide qualitative information on short-term economic movements, especially at the turning points, rather than quantitative measures. Therefore, the main message of CLI movements over time is the increase or decrease, rather than the amplitude of the changes. The OECD&amp;rsquo;s headline indicator is the amplitude adjusted CLI. In practice, turning points in the de-trended reference series have been found about 4 to 8 months (on average) after the signals of turning points had been detected in the headline CLI. The full list of component series used in the calculation of each country's CLI is available on the OECD website at: http://www.oecd.org/std/leading-indicators/oecdcompositeleadingindicatorsreferenceturningpointsandcomponentseries.htm .

opec-annual-statistical-bulletin-2015;2018-08-01;;Knoema;World;WORLD;http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/35.htm;Public;;;;;;OPEC Annual Statistical Bulletin;"The OPEC Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB) provides detailed and comprehensive time-series data on many different aspects of the global petroleum industry, including production, demand, imports and exports, as well as exploration, production and transportation activities.The publication contains, in particular, key statistical data on oil and natural gas activities in each of OPEC&amp;rsquo;s 12 Member Countries: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Additionally, it provides valuable industry data for various countries with detailed classifications mainly by geographical region, and covers the major economic areas around the world.This year&amp;rsquo;s 2015 ASB, which comprises data up to the end of 2015, includes the following important highlights:In 2015, world crude oil production increased by 1.75 million barrels/day (b/d), or 2.4 per cent, as compared to 2014, marking the second highest increase within the last ten years. Among non-OPEC Countries, the biggest yearly increase was for the United States, which grew by 0.72m b/d, or 8.3 per cent, leading to the highest production level since the early 1970s. Crude production during 2015 also increased in the United Kingdom, which saw growth of 0.10m b/d, or 13.4 per cent, for the first time since 1999. Similarly, Norway, which had already reversed its downward trend in 2014, continued to increase in 2015 by 0.06m b/d, or 3.7 per cent. OPEC crude oil production averaged 32.32m b/d during 2015, increasing by 0.93m b/d, or 3.0 per cent, over 2014, the first surge in production after two years of decline. In 2015, the top three crude oil producing countries were Saudi Arabia (10.19m b/d), Russia (10.11m b/d) and the United States (9.43m b/d). Saudi Arabia displaced Russia from first place for the first time since 2005.In 2015, OPEC petroleum export revenues fell by 45.8 per cent from 2014 to $518.2 billion, marking the lowest level seen since 2005. Total OPEC posted a current account deficit of $99.6bn in 2015 compared with a surplus of $238.1bn in 2014. Notably, the last time OPEC recorded a current account deficit was in 1998. In value, total OPEC exports declined by 29.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) while total imports fell 8.7 per cent y-o-y.World oil demand averaged 93.0m b/d in 2015, up by 1.7 per cent y-o-y, with the largest increases taking place in Asia Pacific, particularly India and China, North America, Western Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Total OECD oil demand grew soundly during 2015, while it declined in Latin America for the first time since 2003. OPEC oil demand remained robust during 2015 in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, while it declined in Latin America &amp;mdash; gasoline, kerosene and distillates accounted for the bulk of growth. Distillates and gasoline account for around 56 per cent of total world oil demand and were on increasing trends, while residual fuel oil requirements declined for another year. Gasoline dominated 2015 oil demand growth in Asia Pacific and North America, while distillates appeared robust in Western and Eastern Europe.Total OPEC crude oil exports stood at 23.6m b/d in 2015, up slightly from 23.2m b/d in 2014. This increase represents 1.7 per cent growth y-o-y. The bulk of OPEC crude oil was exported to the Asia Pacific region at a volume of 14.5m b/d or 61.5 per cent. Significant volumes were also exported to Europe, which increased its imports from OPEC MCs to 4.2m b/d in 2015, from 4.0m b/d in 2014. North America imported 2.8m b/d of crude oil from OPEC MCs, 10.6 per cent less than during 2014.Total world proven crude oil reserves stood at 1,493 billion barrels in 2015, increasing slightly by 0.1 per cent from the previous year&amp;rsquo;s level of 1,490bn b. The largest additions came from Angola, Venezuela and IR Iran, while declines were seen in Norway, the UK and Colombia. OPEC increased its proven crude oil reserves by 0.1 per cent to 1,211bn b in 2015, maintaining their share of 81.2 per cent of total world crude oil reserves.In 2015, proven natural gas reserves declined by 0.3 per cent to approximately 202.0 trillion standard cu m. This decrease came on the back of high natural gas production and lower expenditures on exploration and development, mainly as a result of lower gas prices. Total world natural gas marketed production increased by 1.9 per cent in 2015 to reach 3.6 trillion standard cu m; increases occurred mainly in North America and the Middle East.World refinery capacity expanded by 0.8m b/cd to stand at 96.6m b/cd during 2015, mainly supported by additions in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. In the Middle East, expansions came largely from OPEC MCs, while in the Asia Pacific region growth came predominantly from India and China. Refinery capacity in the OECD region continued to decline despite small gains seen in the United States. Global refinery throughput ramped up by 2.4 per cent to reach 80.5m b/d in 2015, with the largest gains seen in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. In the Middle East, gains in refinery throughput originated in OPEC MCs, while India and China dominated the increases seen in the Asia and Pacific region.The OPEC Reference Basket averaged $49.49/b in 2015, down from $96.29/b in 2014 and dropping to the lowest yearly average observed since 2004. The yearly decline was valued at $46.80/b, or 48.6 per cent, as compared to 2014. Volatility in 2015 stood at $8.50/b, or 17.2 per cent, relative to the yearly average.

The only goal of this report is to characterize research outcomes of organizations so as to provide useful scientometric information to institutions, policymakers and research manager so they are able to analyze, evaluate and improve their research results. If someone uses this report to rank institutions or to build a league table with any purpose, he/she will do it under his/her own responsibility.Output - Total number of documents published in scholarly journals indexed in Scopus (Romo-Fern&amp;aacute;ndez, et al., 2011).International Collaboration - Institution's output ratio produced in collaboration with foreign institutions. The values are computed by analyzing an institution's output whose affiliations include more than one country address (Guerrero-Bote, Olmeda-G&amp;oacute;mez and Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n, 2013; Lancho-Barrantes, Guerrero-Bote and Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n, 2013; Lancho-Barrantes, et al., 2013; Chinchilla-Rodr&amp;iacute;guez, et al., 2012)Normalized Impact - Normalized Impact is computed using the methodology established by the Karolinska Intitutet in Sweden where it is named ""Item oriented field normalized citation score average"". The normalization of the citation values is done on an individual article level. The values (in %) show the relationship between an institution's average scientific impact and the world average set to a score of 1, --i.e. a NI score of 0.8 means the institution is cited 20% below world average and 1.3 means the institution is cited 30% above average (Rehn and Kronman, 2008; Gonz&amp;aacute;lez-Pereira, Guerrero-Bote and Moya- Aneg&amp;oacute;n, 2011).High Quality Publications - Ratio of publications that an institution publishes in the most influential scholarly journals of the world, those ranked in the first quartile (25%) in their categories as ordered by SCImago Journal Rank (SJRII) indicator (Miguel, Chinchilla-Rodr&amp;iacute;guez and Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n, 2011).Specialization Index - The Specialization Index indicates the extent of thematic concentration /dispersion of an institution&amp;rsquo;s scientific output. Values range between 0 and 1, indicating generalist vs. specialized institutions respectively. This indicator is computed according to the Gini Index used in Economy (Moed, et. al., 2011; L&amp;oacute;pez-Illescas, Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n and Moed, 2011; Arencibia-Jorge et al., 2012). In this indicator, when the value is 0 it means that the data are not sufficient to calculate.Excellence Rate - Excellence rate indicates the amount (in %) of an institution&amp;rsquo;s scientific output that is included into the set of the 10% of the most cited papers in their respective scientific fields. It is a measure of high quality output of research institutions (SCImago Lab, 2011; Bornmann, Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n and Leydesdorff, 2012; Guerrero-Bote and Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n, 2012).Scientific Leadership - Leadership indicates an institution&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;output as main contributor&amp;rdquo;, that is the number of papers in which the corresponding author belongs to the institution (Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n, 2012; Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n et. al, 2013; Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n, et al., forthcoming) Excellence with Leadership - Excellence with Leadership indicates the amount of documents in the Excellence rate in which the institution is the main contributor (Moya-Aneg&amp;oacute;n, et al., 2013).";Demography;Education, World Rankings;;en;;2016-12-20T11:30:45+00:00;;;2018-09-27T12:08:09+00:00;2018-10-27T12:06:12+00:00;Scimago Lab;http://www.scimagoir.com;21383;;;;;vqsbqfe.csv;;;2016-12-20;2014-06-03;;;;;ANNUALLY;;2009 - 2013;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;10

quality-of-government-institute-standard-dataset-2016;;;Knoema;World;WORLD;;Public;;;;;;Quality of Government Institute Standard Dataset;"It has been one year since we last launched an updated version of the QoG Standard dataset. We have made some changes to the datasets, the method used for updating it, and to the actual codebook, but if you have used the datasets before they will probably feel familiar. The codebook is now created automatically on the basis of meta-data that we extract from the QoG-Datasets. On this basis, we run mata-code in Stata and create the Latex-code, which we compile to the PDF that you can download. Most importantly though is the fact that we in the current version not only have updated old data sources but we have also include many new ones as well. This means that the new QoG Standard approximately includes over 2000 variables, which is a lot more compared to older versions. For this reason, we have also abandoned the old heuristic in dividing the variables into the three categories of &amp;ldquo;what it is&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how to get it&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;what you get&amp;rdquo;. Instead the variables in the current version are divided into sixteen thematic categories such as Quality of Government, Economy, Media, Environment, and Political System etc. You will find more information about this under the section of Variable Categories in the Codebook. We hope that this new division will facilitate your search for variables. Since the launch of the QoG Standard Dataset it has received the Lijphart, Przeworski, Verba Award for Best Dataset by the APSA Comparative Politics Section in 2009.

global-hunger-index-2015;2017-07-26;;Knoema;World;WORLD;http://www.ifpri.org/copyright;Public;;;;;;Global hunger index;"The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a tool designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger globally, regionally, and by country. Each year, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) calculates GHI scores in order to assess progress, or the lack thereof, in decreasing hunger. The GHI is designed to raise awareness and understanding of regional and country differences in the struggle against hunger.This year, GHI scores have been calculated using a revised and improved formula. The revision replaces child underweight, previously the sole indicator of child undernutrition, with two indicators of child undernutrition&amp;mdash;child wasting and child stunting&amp;mdash;which are equally weighted in the GHI calculation. The revised formula also standardizes each of the component indicators to balance their contribution to the overall index and to changes in the GHI scores over time.The 2015 GHI has been calculated for 117 countries for which data on the four component indicators are available and where measuring hunger is considered most relevant. GHI scores are not calculated for some higher income countries where the prevalence of hunger is very low. The GHI is only as current as the data for its four component indicators.This year's GHI reflects the most recent available country-level data and projections available between 2010 and 2016. It therefore reflects the hunger levels during this period rather than solely capturing conditions in 2015. The 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2015 GHI scores reflect the latest revised data for the four component indicators of the GHI. Where original source data were not available, the estimates of the GHI component indicators were based on the most recent data available.The four component indicators used to calculate the GHI scores draw upon data from the following sources:1. Undernourishment: Updated data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) were used for the 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2015 GHI scores. Undernourishment data and projections for the 2015 GHI are for 2014-2016.2. Child wasting and stunting: The child undernutrition indicators of the GHI&amp;mdash;child wasting and child stunting&amp;mdash;include data from the joint database of United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Bank, and additional data from WHO's continuously updated Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition; the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) reports; statistical tables from UNICEF; and the latest national survey data for India from UNICEF India. For the 2015 GHI, data on child wasting and child stunting are for the latest year for which data are available in the period 2010-2014.3. Child mortality: Updated data from the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation were used for the 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005, and 2015 GHI scores.

Total energy consumption - for each energy product it is the sum of primary production, external trade, marine bunkers (fuel used by boats and aircraft for international transport) and stock variations. For the world, marine bunkers are included. This induces a gap with the sum of regions. Total primary production evaluates the quantity of natural energy resources. Total balance of trade is the difference between exports and imports. The balance of a net exporter appears as a negative value (-). The balance of geographic and geopolitical zones is simply the sum of the trade balance of all the countries. The energy intensity is calculated by dividing the total energy consumption of a country by its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It measures the total amount of energy necessary to generate one unit of GDP. GDP is expressed at constant exchange rate and purchasing power parity to remove the impact of inflation and reflect differences in general price levels and relate energy consumption to the real level of economic activity. Using purchasing power parity rates for GDP instead of exchange rates increases the value of GDP in regions with a low cost of living, and therefore decreases their energy intensities.

The data from which these carbon-emissions estimates were derived are values of fuel consumed: in billions of cubic feet, for natural gas; in millions of barrels, for petroleum products; and in thousands of short tons, for coal. The resulting emissions estimates are expressed as teragrams of carbon. A teragram is 10^12 grams, or 10^6 metric tons. The fuel-consumption values were multiplied by their respective thermal conversion factors, which are in units of heat energy per unit of fuel (i.e., per cubic foot, barrel, or ton). In keeping with conventional usage in the United States, values are for the gross (higher) heating values of the respective fuels. The results are expressed in units of heat energy derived from the fuel.

It has significant implications for issues of quantity and quality of water resources. This dataset shows water abstractions by source (surface and ground water) and by major uses. Water abstractions refer to water taken from ground or surface water sources and conveyed to the place of use. If the water is returned to a surface water source, abstraction of the same water by the downstream user is counted again in compiling total withdrawal.

Most high-income oil exporters, primarily in the GCC, continue to record steady growth and solid economic and financial fundamentals, albeit with medium-term challenges that need to be addressed. In contrast, other countries --Iraq, Libya, Syria -- mired in conflicts with not just humanitarian but also economic consequences. And yet other countries, mostly oil importers, are making continued but uneven progress in advancing their economic agenda, often in tandem with political transitions and amidst difficult social conditions. In most of these countries, without extensive economic and structural reforms, economic prospects for the medium term remain insufficient to reduce high unemployment and improve living standards. Economic activity in the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) region is weakening, mainly because of the near-term slowdown and rising regional tensions affecting Russia, a key trading partner and sources of remittance and investment inflows, as well as weaker domestic demand in a number of CCA countries. Near-term risks are to the downside and tied to the fortunes of large trading partners. Policies need to focus on bolstering economic stability and, where needed, short-term support to ailing economic growth. In addition, a new model for high, sustained, diversified, and inclusive growth is needed to set the direction for economic policies for the next decade.</p>;Crude Oil & Refined Products, Economy;Prices, Production;Public Domain;en;;2017-01-22T11:40:10+00:00;;;2018-09-27T12:02:26+00:00;2018-10-27T12:01:03+00:00;International Monetary Fund; http://data.imf.org/?sk=7CB6619C-CF87-48DC-9443-2973E161ABEB&sId=1393468009141;15812;;;;;;;;;2016-04-24;;;;;Annually;;2004-2017;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;19

Agriculture is the main source of ammonia emissions, with shares ranging on   average between 80% and 99%. Ammonia with sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen   oxides (NOx) contribute to acidification of soil and water when it combines   with water in the atmosphere or after deposition. Deposition of ammonia can   also raise nitrogen levels in soil and water, which may contribute to   eutrophication in receiving aquatic ecosystems. Deposited ammonia can also   contribute to the emissions of nitrous oxide, which is a GHG. Ammonia in the   atmosphere can also combine with industrial and transport pollution   generating secondary particulate pollution. Indicator: Ammonia (NH3)   emissions from agriculture as a % of total NH3 emissions. Methodology: Share   Ammonia from agriculture/total Ammonia emissions (%): (Total Ammonia   emissions from agriculture)/(Total Ammonia emissions) * 100.

Agriculture also produces energy as biofuels and biomass production. As an   energy user, Agriculture contributes to global warming (mainly through CO2   emissions, but also CH4 and N2O emissions), air pollution (mainly through NOx   and SO2 emissions) and to the depletion of fossil energy resources. Important   energy users are glasshouse horticulture, floriculture and dairy production.   Agriculture can make a contribution to the mitigation of climate change and   air pollution effects through more efficient energy use and through the   production of renewable energy (bio-energy production). Indicator: Agriculture   and forestry energy used as a % of total energy use, measured as Agr.Energy   use/Total Energy Use)*100. BIOENERGY: Bioenergy refers to energy derived from   the biological carbon fixation of plants or from biological tissues. Examples   are biodiesel, derived from vegetable oils and animal fats, and bioethanol,   produced by the fermentation of carbohydrates of crops like corn. The   production of biomass for energy production has important effects on rural   development, international policy and economy, and on the environment: it   supports the rural economy creating jobs and gives farmers a source of income   complementary to food production. Biofuels have also an impact on economy and   trade, since they reduce the dependence on oil-producing countries. Being derived   from plants, their production contributes to carbon sequestration. Biofuels   production presents also some issues, such as the increased pressure on water   resources, deforestation (to clear land to cultivate fuel crops), and the   change in use of land originally intended for food production. Indicator:   Bioenergy production as a % of total energy production. Methodology: Sum of   different bioenergy (e.g. biodiesel, biogases).

Conversion of agricultural land to artificial surfaces   (soil sealing) can have several environmental impacts on soil, water and   biodiversity resources. A general decrease in agricultural areas has been   observed in the last decades in industrialized countries as a consequence of   growing demand for nature conservation areas, urban, industrial and   infrastructural areas, amenity areas, and also as a consequence of land   abandonment. Many land development activities result in land use change from   agricultural land to artificial surfaces: transport infrastructure   (motorways, railways, etc.), urban sprawl (housing and industrial   developments, tourism and recreation facilities. Increased land development   of ten results in higher prices for land and has an important impact on the   environment and on agricultural landscapes. The impact is obviously very   diversified in the case of a change to urban land compared to the case of   land abandonment. Terrestrial protected areas are defined by the   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as â€œa clearly defined   geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other   effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation; nature with   associated ecosystem services and cultural valuesâ€ (Dudley, 2008).   Protected areas are monitored as indicator 7.6 in the U.N. Millennium   Indicators Frameworks (Proportion of terrestrial and marine areas protected).   The extent of the protected areas is an indicator of Governmentsâ€™ will to   protect biodiversity, however, it does not furnish information on how well   the areas are managed or that protection measures are effectively enforced.

Erosion is a natural process, but human activities can greatly influence its   rate, especially through agriculture and deforestation. According to the U.N.   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, approximately 40% of the world's   agricultural land is seriously degraded. In natural conditions, only very   severe meteorological events will cause erosion, as the vegetation cover, the   leaf litter and the organic matter will protect the soil absorbing rain   impacts and preventing soil removal. Removal of the natural vegetation cover   due to practices such as: deforestation; overgrazing; or industrial farming practices   (e.g. tillage), leaves the soil exposed to the action of climatic factors,   such as rain and wind. The global survey on human-induced soil degradation is   the GLASOD (Global Assessment of Human-Induced Soil Degradation), prepared   jointly by ISRIC and UNEP during the 1980â€™s. The GLASOD database is the   only global dataset available on soil degradation. However, there are issues   related to its quality, which is not homogeneous, and therefore statistics   obtained from these maps are not always reliable (Sonneveld and Dent 2007).   Better statistics on soil degradation will be possible with the new version   of the FAO GLADIS dataset which should be released shortly. Soil quality can   be defined as â€œthe capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within   natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal   productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and support human   health and habitation. Soil quality is defined according to the soil   functions (e.g. bearing function, production function, habitat function,   resources function, reactor function) and cannot be measured by a single   parameter. However, soil organic carbon has been defined by EUROSTAT as the   more appropriate indicator for soil quality. High organic carbon content   corresponds to good conditions from an agro-environmental point of view.   Soils with organic carbon content less than 1% in weight are generally   affected by soil degradation processes and erosion. On the other hand, soils   with 1-10% organic carbon content have high agricultural value. The data used   for the production of this indicator are geo-spatial raster data contained in   the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) released by FAO, IIASA, ISRIC,   ISSCAS, and JRC in 2008 with a spatial resolution of 30 by 30 arc seconds   (approximately 1 Km). Spatial data were extracted through appropriate queries   from the geo-database and then spatial statistics were calculated at the   country level.</td></tr></tbody></table>";Environment;Soil;Public Domain;en;;2017-01-30T09:19:12+00:00;;;2018-09-27T12:08:03+00:00;2018-10-27T12:05:49+00:00;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ES;595;;;;;;;;;2013-01-16;;;;;ANNUALLY;;1991-2008;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;9

evaluating-building-energy-efficiency-investment-options-for-sa;;;;Saudi Arabia;EMEA;https://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Evaluating Building Energy Efficiency Investment Options for SA;"<div><div><strong>About the Project<br/><br/></strong></div> <div>Increasing energy productivity holds some of the greatest possibilities for enhancing the welfare countries get out of their energy systems. It also recasts energy efficiency in terms of boosting competitiveness and wealth, more powerfully conveying its profound benefits to society.  </div><div>KAPSARC and UNESCWA have initiated this project to explore the energy productivity potential of the Arab region, starting with the six GCC countries and later extending to other countries. </div> <div>Aimed at policymakers, this project highlights the social gains from energy productivity investments, where countries are currently at, and pathways to achieving improved performance in this area.</div><strong><br/><br/>KEY POINTS</strong><br/><br/>This study suggests that energy efficiency programs in buildings can provide up to a 27 percent reduction in electricity consumption and a 30 percent reduction in peak electricity demand for Saudi Arabia.</div>
 <div>It is well recognized, however, that given the low electricity prices in Saudi Arabia there is little incentive for households and businesses to invest in energy efficiency. On the other hand, when system-wide benefits of energy efficiency investments are included their value is much higher, especially from the government's perspective. These wider benefits include the reduced need for new electricity generation capacity investment, reduced carbon emissions and new employment opportunities. Among the key findings are: </div>
 
<ul>
<li>Investments in residential buildings are by far the most cost effective, with payback periods of less than a year for low cost energy efficiency programs. More ambitious plans with a wider scope have longer payback periods depending on the prevailing electricity price. This finding sits somewhat in contrast to the current focus of public policy on government buildings. </li></ul><ul>
<li>The potential reduction in the need for new power generation capacity could drive up to around $28 billion in reduced capital expenditure over a 10-year period. </li></ul><ul>
<li>Depending on the retail electricity price and scope of the efficiency program, the value of avoided energy consumption could be as much as $17 billion per year.   </li></ul><ul>
<li>We estimate that the measures explored in this report could generate up to 247,000 jobs per year by the end of a 10-year investment program.  </li></ul><div>Successful implementation will require the building of strong institutional and labor force capacities and strengthened policy frameworks. In particular, we recommend that the current KSA building energy efficiency code is enforced for all new buildings, that the code is gradually mandated for the entire existing building stock and that electricity prices are steadily increased to better reward efficiency investments. <br/></div>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion Paper;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-02-06T12:57:41+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:14+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/KS-1655-DP049A-Evaluating-Building-Energy-Efficiency-Investment-Options-for-SA_web.pdf;0;Kankana Dubey, Nicholas Howarth, Moncef Krarti;;;;;;;2016-10-26;2016-10-26;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;UNESCWA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>KAPSARC is analyzing the shifting dynamics of the global gas markets. Global gas
markets have turned upside down during the past five years: North America has
emerged as a large potential future LNG exporter while gas demand growth has been
slowing down as natural gas gets squeezed between coal and renewables. While the
coming years will witness the fastest LNG export capacity expansion ever seen, many
questions are raised on the next generation of LNG supply, the impact of low oil and gas
prices on supply and demand patterns and how pricing and contractual structure may
be affected by both the arrival of U.S. LNG on global gas markets and the desire of
Asian buyers for cheaper gas.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Substantial changes to global liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets, including the move toward the creation of an Asian trading hub, more flexibility through an increase of spot and short-term trade, liberalization in key Asian markets, emergence of new players and current oversupply, call for better access to existing regasification terminals, which does not hamper the development of new infrastructure. </p>
<p>Around 420 million tons per annum (mtpa) or 54 percent of global regasification capacity offers, in theory, some sort of third-party access (TPA). However, this access happens rarely in practice outside of Europe. Many terminals in other regions don’t offer TPA due to a lack of gas market liberalization and control of LNG terminals by incumbents</p>
<p>Access to LNG terminals may prove to be a cornerstone of successful liberalization policies in Asia given the key role of LNG as a source of gas supply. </p>

<p>Regulators could opt for full or partial TPA or to implement an effective secondary market for TPA-exempted terminals to prevent capacity hoarding and minimize contractual congestions.</p>
<p>Access to infrastructure – both pipeline and LNG import capacity – is a key factor for the establishment of a functioning trading hub. This goes hand-in-hand with initiatives to get rid of final destination clauses.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, LNG, liquefied ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-02-09T13:22:48+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:54+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KS-1760-DP53A-Third-Party-Access-to-Regasification-Terminals-Adapting-to-the-LNG-Markets-Reconfiguration-.pdf;0;Sammy Six, Anne-Sophie Corbeau;;;;;;;2017-02-09;2017-02-09;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

For most countries, published series   start in 1990.  <br/>     <br/>     Whenever available, the database integrates national accounts data   harvested from UNSD National Accounts Official Country Data (UNSD OCD) or   OECD STAN and OECD Annual National Accounts (OECD ANA). To make data   comparable across countries and over time, national data series have been   rescaled to pair the ISIC Rev. 3 levels (linking of series is done by   applying ratios computed on    overlapping years of data) and re-referenced using the UNSD National   Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates database. If the full set of national   accounts data on the above-mentioned set of agriculture capital related   variables is not available for a specific country from these sources,   estimation procedures are employed to construct complete time series. For a   description of the procedures implemented to obtain complete time series on   GFCFAFF, net and gross CSAFF, and CFCAFF, see the â€œData Compilationâ€   section underneath. <br/>     <br/>     Country data on Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in agriculture,   forestry and fishery, either as complete time series or just data for a few   individual years, are available for just over 100 countries, originating   mainly from the UNSD NA OCD, and OECD STAN and OECD ANA. <br/>     <br/>     Country data on agricultural Net Capital Stock (NCSAFF), Gross Capital   Stock (GCSAFF) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFCAFF) are available only   for a limited number of countries - to a large extent from OECD countries and   included in the OECD STAN database. For some 20 other countries data are also   availed from the UNSD National Accounts Official Country Data. Data on Gross   Capital Stock (GCS) is available only for a few OECD countries. Based on the   dataset on agriculture GFCF, FAO calculates NCSAFF, GCSAFF and CFCAFF series   for all countries for which country data are not available from the above   mentioned sources. To that end, a variation of the perpetual inventory method   is used (for further details, see â€œData Compilationâ€ section   below).<br/>     <br/>     <br/>     <br/>     Series are also presented in Constant prices. The total economy GFCF   deflators from UNSD National Accounts Estimates have been used for non-OECD   countries. As for OECD countries, GFCFAFF specific deflator series in ISIC   Rev.3 A+B are used when available. For other cases, the GFCF-total economy   deflator for GFCF has been used. The same deflators as for GFCFAFF have been   used for GCSAFF, NCSAFF and CFCAFF.</td></tr></tbody></table>";Economy, Agriculture;Consumption, Fixed, Capital, Forestry, Fishing, Net, Gross, GFCF, Formation, Stock, Agriculture, Price;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-02-26T10:00:57+00:00;;;2018-11-02T13:49:48+00:00;2018-11-02T13:49:49+00:00;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/CS;91635;;;;;;;;;2016-08-18;;;;;Annually;;1990 - 2014;Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;34

<p>The project assesses the effectiveness of current electric vehicle policy in leading the technology toward self sustained market competitiveness.

<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Passenger cars are responsible for a large and steadily growing share of global energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Electric vehicles (EVs) powered by renewable electricity have the potential to provide a substantial contribution to the decarbonization of passenger car transport. Unless carbon capture and storage technologies become cost competitive, EVs are likely to form a growing share of the personal mobility solution. But what is the lowest cost path to achieving high levels of EV penetration?</p>
<p>Encouraged by the falling cost of batteries, EV policy today focuses on expediting electrification, paying comparatively little attention to the cost of the particular type of EVs and charging infrastructure being deployed. This paper argues that, due to its strong influence on EV innovation paths, EV policy could be better designed if it paid more attention to future cost and technology development risk. In particular, key findings include:</p>
<p>EV policy with a strong bias toward long-range battery electric vehicles (BEVs) risks leading to a higher cost of electrification in the 2030 timeframe, possibly exceeding the ability of governments to sustain the necessary incentives until battery cost drops sufficiently.</p>
<p>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with long electric range could allow intermediate decarbonization targets to be met while being less sensitive to the rate of development of battery technology. The BEV option could be pursued in parallel by targeting specific segments where shorter ranges are acceptable to their users.</p>
<p>Promoting a balanced mix of BEVs and PHEVs could set the electrification of passenger cars on a lower risk, lower cost, path that is more likely to become self-sustained before government support is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Examining EV policy in the U.K. and in California, we find that it is generally not incompatible with achieving balanced mixes of BEVs and PHEVs. However, this may not be sufficient and some fine tuning would enable better balancing of medium-term risks and long-term goals.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, Electric vehicles,  Emissions;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-02-28T13:22:47+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:53+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KS-2017-DP02-Will-Current-Electric-Vehicle-Policy-Lead-to-Cost-Effective-Electrification1.pdf;0;Marcello Contestabile, Mohammed Alajaji, Bader Almubarak;;;;;;;2017-02-28;2017-02-28;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>After decades of development and false starts, electric vehicles have now become commercial. However, they still rely on strong policy support for their further development and adoption.</p>
<p>The project assesses the effectiveness of current electric vehicle policy in leading the technology toward self sustained market competitiveness. The multi-method approach chosen involves techno-economic, strategy and innovation systems analysis. In particular, we have developed a bottom-up electric vehicle fleet cost model in order to assess the economic implications of electric vehicle policy.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This paper discusses the model we have developed at KAPSARC for estimating the relative costs of passenger car fleets containing low-emission vehicles of different types, particularly with emphasis on electric vehicles. The main purpose of the model is to enable analysis of low-emission vehicle policy; in particular, we have so far applied it to the analysis of the cost implications of supporting different types of EVs and battery charging infrastructures. The model has been designed for simplicity, transparency and ease of use by non-expert stakeholders. As such the approach taken is inspired by metamodelling, i.e.,: we draw on the results of different existing pieces of techno-economic analysis and we bring them together in a simple modelling framework, which allows for the testing of the highlevel cost implications in a transparent way. The model has also been designed such that it can be easily updated when new evidence becomes available or adapted to analyze different vehicle and infrastructure technologies.</p>
<p>The model calculates the Relative Cost of Ownership (RCO) of individual vehicles, selected as representative of main market segments in the passenger car fleet that is the subject of our study. For each of these vehicles, we model both its internal combustion engine (ICE) version and all main electric powertrain types, i.e.,: battery electric (BEV), range-extended electric (RE-EV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV). In the case of the electric powertrain vehicles, the user can select the desired battery size and charging infrastructure coverage. The user can then also select fleet penetration levels of each powertrain type by market segment, and the model adds up all the RCO of the individual vehicles over the whole fleet to return the incremental annual cost of passeng</p>
<p>In addition to the total cost of the fleet, the model can also estimate fleet average CO2 emissions, both tailpipe and Well-to-Wheel, and overall infrastructure utilization levels. Analysis of vehicle cost and emissions at segment level is also possible. A quick guide on how to use the simplified version of the model, which is available online is provided at the end of the paper.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Methodology papers, Fleet;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-02-28T13:22:47+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:54+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KS-2017-MP-01-KAPSARC-Vehicle-Fleet-Model-Cost-of-Electrification1.pdf;0;Marcello Contestabile, Mohammed Alajaji, Bader Almubarak;;;;;;;2017-02-28;2017-02-28;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

economic-stability-in-the-gcc-countries;;;;Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates;EMEA;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Economic Stability in the GCC Countries;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>The project explores alternative methods of measuring economic diversification and investigating its associated impacts on the Saudi Arabian economy and other GCC countries. By utilizing a financial portfolio framework reconciled with economic growth theory, the economy is viewed as a portfolio of economic sectors, each contributing to the overall output growth. Results demonstrated that diversification policies have been effective, as the economy moves towards higher growth with lower instability.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Evidence confirms that there is a positive correlation between the economic growth rate and its volatility/risk in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. In other words, there is a trade-off between the benefits of oil and gas activity and the volatility resulting from unpredictable commodity price swings in such resource dependent economies. </p>
<p>Our analysis uses a financial portfolio framework approach (and more specifically an efficient frontier analysis), treating economic sectors as individual investments. We calculate a relative risk measure termed the ‘beta coefficient’ and assemble a portfolio of sectors with varying weights to find the efficient frontier. If the beta of the portfolio representing the economy is above global average, the economy will generally grow faster than the global average but with greater volatility – the upturns will be higher and the downturns deeper. We aim to shed light on diversification policy from this novel, if not yet widely accepted, perspective. </p>
<p>The GCC economies exhibit ‘high beta,’ particularly Qatar. Saudi Arabia sits in the middle of the group, but above the global average, while Oman has the lowest coefficient of the group.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s National Transformation Plan to 2020 and economic Vision 2030 envisage an economy that is still invested in oil and gas activity at 45 percent of total output. While diversification policies in these plans promote economic growth, it still leaves the economy exposed to the volatility of energy markets. In comparison, the optimal mix of economic sectors could increase the growth rate by more than 1 percent annually and nearly halve the expected volatility (to less than 60 percent of growth rate).</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s historical economic policies were effective in achieving some diversification. However, their benefits could be increased by policies that balance productive efficiency with diversification of economic activity. </p>
<p>The difference between policy-optimized portfolio and non-constrained optimization can be used to estimate the size of the fiscal stabilization fund needed to protect the economy from stop/go risks to diversification objectives. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, Stability ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-03-08T13:22:46+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:53+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KS-2017-DP03-Economic-Stability-in-the-GCC-Countries.pdf;0;Nayef Almusehel, Ziyad Alfawzan;;;;;;;2017-03-08;2017-03-08;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
reporting-lcoe-for-solar-pv-apples-to-apples-comparisons;;;;World;WORLD;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Reporting LCOE for Solar PV: Apples to Apples Comparisons;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>As solar PV installations continue to grow globally, a better understanding of the generation costs of this industry is important to assess its competitiveness versus conventional generation technologies. Using reported LOCE values for the solar industry, a normalization procedure which levels the playing field between reported values, was applied. The normalization procedure enables performing apples-to-apples comparisons between different projects. Accepting an LCOE figure without being aware of the underlying assumptions can result in erroneous conclusions. With the aid of the normalization exercise carried out in this paper, policymakers and investors are able to make more informed decisions: policymakers can look to formulate well-targeted budgets for renewable support, while investors can envisage a clearer picture of their expected revenues.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Solar energy is expected to be an integral technology in the creation of a low-carbon future. Hence, as photovoltaics (PV) installations continue to grow at an exponential rate, a better understanding of the generation costs of this relatively young industry is necessary in order to assess its competitiveness versus conventional sources. Using an extensive dataset of generation costs for solar technology, this study finds:</p>
<p>Despite its inherent shortcomings, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is still the de facto metric used by research centers, private sector and government institutions to quantify electricity generation costs.</p>
<p>The LCOE range for solar generation is significantly larger than that for conventional generation. This large spread for solar is mainly attributed to differences on how detailed the calculation of the LCOE is, the use of outdated or inaccurate assumptions, and/or not being explicit about the financial conditions including policy support</p>
<p>To compare different solar LCOEs equitably, we applied a ‘normalization’ procedure. The reported LCOE values were recalculated using numerical inputs stemming from global norms to fill gaps or deal with location-specific artefacts. Normalizing assumptions were applied to all the LCOE data points used in this paper. As expected, the spread decreases considerably</p>
<p>This normalization procedure, which leveled the playing field for reported LCOEs, suggests that the large variation in solar LCOE values that is generally accepted in literature is overstated. Furthermore, power purchase agreement prices for recent competitive bids should not be confused with LCOE and care is needed when comparing projects to ensure that a ‘new record’ was in fact achieved.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, LCOE, PV;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-03-08T13:22:46+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:54+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KS-2017-DP05-Reporting-LCOE-for-Solar-PV-Apples-to-Apples-Comparisons.pdf;0;Amro Elshurafa;;;;;;;2017-03-08;2017-03-08;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
gasoline-demand-pricing-policy-and-social-welfare-in-saudi-arabia0;;;;Saudi Arabia;EMEA;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Gasoline Demand, Pricing Policy and Social Welfare in Saudi Arabia;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>KAPSARC’s projects on energy demand model how factors such as income, prices and energy efficiency influence energy demand in different countries, with a strong focus on Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council. The project’s objective is to quantify the influence of each of these factors and estimate the relative levels of energy efficiency across different sectors of the economy. Our energy demand research also looks at the welfare implications of policies that influence energy demand.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>In the face of low international oil prices, countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council recently implemented fuel price reform across a number of sectors. Saudi Arabia, for example, announced in December 2015 an increase in the gasoline price. We undertook a welfare analysis in this paper to estimate the net gain in social welfare that resulted from this price increase. Our results show that:</p>
<p>Gasoline demand is generally price inelastic in Saudi Arabia, the current lack of alternative transport modes, particularly within cities, being one possible reason. Our preferred econometric estimates suggest that the price elasticity is between -0.09 and -0.15. Therefore, the gasoline price increase is unlikely to dampen domestic demand significantly.</p>
<p>The gasoline price increase could potentially result in a net gain in social welfare of as much as SAR 2 billion annually at 2010 prices, which is equivalent to 0.1 percent of the Kingdom’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015.</p>

<p>This research program seeks to combine remote sensing and social science methods to study energy development, energy use and inform energy policy. This is a novel research program that does not exist at the leading energy research centers in the world. The impact of this research program could yield new and significant insights in how energy is measured and studied. The research team has launched two pilot projects in 2017, with an eye toward expanding KAPSARC’s research into RS3 by the end of 2017 and into 2018. These projects blend remote sensing techniques with social science approaches to understand how energy use and energy development are affecting communities, cities and regions. </p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Human Geography of Energy describes a methodology that utilizes remote sensing and social science methods to answer research questions about energy use and energy development. To explore the potential of this approach, KAPSARC organized workshops in London and Boulder, Colorado to work out whether technology and tools had matured sufficiently to execute such a program and deliver policy relevant insights that could not be achieved by alternate means</p>
<p>Such a program would seek to bring together the right combination of remote sensing approaches to measure changes in land use/land cover, vegetation, population density and settlements.</p>
<p>Social science methods such as household surveys and interviews would be utilized when appropriate to corroborate, validate, or correlate with remote sensing data, so-called ‘ground-truthing,’ yielding more valuable insights than either of the approaches could achieve on its own.</p>
<p>Potential high-impact projects identified include: </p>
<ul>
 <li>Measuring settlement growth and biomass usage in areas with little or no access to formal energy. </li><li>Tracking the impact of energy development and consumption on communities.</li><li>Validating data on stockpiles of coal in China and India, where reliable data are difficult to acquire. </li></ul>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop Series, Energy, Social Science, energy development;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-03-27T13:22:45+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:52+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/KS-2017-WB02-Human-Geography-of-Energy-Combining-Remote-Sensing-and-Social-Science-Approaches1.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2017-03-27;2017-03-27;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

understanding-long-term-consumer-demand-for-fuel-efficient-vehicles;;;;World;WORLD;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Understanding Long-Term Consumer Demand for Fuel-Efficient Vehicles;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>Promoting adoption of energy-efficient vehicles has become a key policy imperative in both developed and developing countries. Understanding the impact of various factors that affect adoption rates, such as: (i) consumer related factors – demographics, behavioral, psychographics; (ii) regulatory factors – policies, incentives, rebates, perks; and (iii) geo-temporal factors – weather, infrastructure, network effects; forms the backbone of KAPSARC’s efforts in the transportation field. Our team is currently developing models at different levels of resolution – micro level models using large-scale data comprising of new car buyers’ profiles and macro level models using aggregated adoption data, to understand and project the effects of various factors at play for the adoption of energy-efficient vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Consumer adoption of fuel-efficient vehicles is a crucial step in improving energy use and reducing emissions from the transportation sector. The range of options includes hybridization of powertrains all the way through to fully electric vehicles. To promote adoption, policymakers have employed supply side policies such as the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions/Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards and the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which require automakers to produce and sell fuel-efficient and alternative fuel vehicles. In addition, demand side measures in the form of financial and non financial incentives promoting ZEV adoption have also been employed. We measure the changes in consumers’ purchase motivations and potential demand in the wake of such programs by analyzing the past 11 years of new vehicle buyer survey data in the United States as a case study. We find that:</p>
<p>Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs), collectively termed xEVs, had the potential to secure as much as ~11 percent of the U.S. automotive market in model year 2015, but the actual market share was only one-third of this.</p>
<p>A narrowing of the consumer’s valuation gap between buyers of non xEVs and xEVs for purchase motivations – including fuel economy, environmental friendliness, technical innovation and price – is increasing the potential consumer demand for xEVs. The term valuation gap refers to the difference between the average rating given by buyers of non xEVs and buyers of xEVs for a particular purchase motivation question in the survey. The closer the ratings, the smaller will be the valuation gap.</p>
<p>Policy instruments such as sales weighted fuel economy target show strong correlation with the consumer valuation gap. In combination with demand side policies that make xEVs more accessible to mainstream consumers, they could be considered as viable tools if policymakers are seeking to nudge consumers toward xEVs.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, GHG , geo-temporal;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-04-16T13:22:44+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:52+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/KS-2017-DP08-Understanding-Long-Term-Consumer-Demand-For-Fuel-Efficient-Vehicles.pdf;0;Rubal Dua, Kenneth White;;;;;;;2017-04-16;2017-04-16;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

	<strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
<div><p>In the face of low international oil prices, countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council recently implemented fuel price reform across a number of sectors.

Our results show that:&nbsp;</p><p>Gasoline demand is generally price inelastic in Saudi Arabia, the current lack of alternative transport modes, particularly within cities, being one possible reason.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>I n this paper we present an overview of KAPSARC’s local content project, its methodological approach and objective. We describe a measurement device (questionnaire) used to quantify different features of local firms surveyed in Uganda. The data collected in these questionnaires provides essential information to help analyze the current state of local firms in Uganda as they gear up to join the oil and gas supply chain. We also comment on each section of the form explaining its purpose. The questionnaire is attached as part of this document in the Appendix.</p>
<p>The design of the questionnaire allows for a combined approach to examining local firms. On the one hand, it is based on selected basic requirements of the oil and gas industry, which companies must usually fulfill if they aspire to be a supplier. On the other, it also considers the local firms from a dynamic perspective, focusing on their potential to adapt and carve a role in the oil and gas supply chain. This perspective is centered on the concepts of innovation and absorptive capacity, which are increasingly considered when evaluating small and medium enterprises (SMEs) at the firm level.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was designed to be used in faceto-face interviews, which is usually recommended for surveys carried out in Africa. The document is relatively lengthy and is intended to be utilized in developing nations, although a few questions would have to be adapted to the characteristics of each country based on the level of development and exposure to the oil and gas industry. </p>
<p>The questionnaire includes five sections to make it more comprehensible. The data collected is extensive, allowing for a variety of analytical approaches.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Methodology papers;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-05-01T13:22:42+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:51+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/KS-2017-MP02-A-Measurement-Device-for-Estimating-Local-Firm-Capabilities-in-New-Oil-Producing-Countries.pdf;0;Marcelo Neuman, Roger Tissot, Daniel Mabrey;;;;;;;2017-05-01;2017-05-01;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>Natural Resource-led Development in New Producing Countries</p>
<p>Our project seeks to understand how natural resource extraction can drive inclusive economic growth in new producing countries. We are engaged in a multiyear multidisciplinary study with four objectives:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Understand the human geography of new producing countries.</li><li>Assess the magnitude of new discoveries and estimate direct fiscal impact.</li><li>Understand how industry can be localized to create economic growth. </li><li>Estimate spillovers and welfare impacts to society. </li>
</ul>

<p>We recognize that policymaking in new producing countries is a complex process, and our project also seeks to understand the interactions of actors' interests that drive energy sector policies. </p>
<p>Our initial focus is on four countries – Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda – that expect to develop significant oil and gas reserves in the next 5-7 years. Through natural resource development, these countries hope to achieve middle-income economic status by 2030-2040. This project is conducted through close collaboration with leading think tanks and NGOs in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Policymakers in new resource-rich Eastern African countries are eager to promote industrialization and economic development by encouraging international oil and gas companies (IOCs) to use local suppliers. However, policymakers usually lack information on the local firms’ abilities and typically depend on studies by the IOCs to assess these capabilities. Such studies are useful and necessary but they usually only address the needs of the IOCs. By considering the capacity of local firms to learn and innovate, vital information is gathered which can then be used to enhance the design of local content policies. It also raises the prospects for the creation of a more sustainable local supplier base.</p>
<p>The assessment of the capabilities of local firms could be improved by introducing the constructs of absorptive capacity and innovation. This would give policymakers a dynamic, instead of static, view of the local industry.</p>
<p>Providing policymakers with a better understanding of the local firms’ potential and ability to learn and grow will allow them to come up with more varied options in the design of local content policies and potentially provide more suppliers for industry.</p>
<p>A wider perspective of the local firms’ capabilities also contributes to the linking of local content policies to the overarching objective of expanding the local economy. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, local content ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-05-01T13:22:43+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:51+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/KS-2017-DP07-A-Conceptual-Framework-for-Measuring-Local-Firm-Capabilities-in-New-Producing-Countries-The-Case-of-Uganda.pdf;0;Marcelo Neuman, Roger Tissot, Daniel Mabrey;;;;;;;2017-05-01;2017-05-01;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The land portion of the database from which the Jones et al. time series are computed consists of surface air temperature (SAT) data (land-surface meteorological data and fixed-position weather ship data) from over 3000 station records that have been corrected for non-climatic errors, such as station shifts and/or instrument changes (Jones 1994). The marine data used are compiled at the Hadley Centre of the United Kingdom Meteorological Office and consist of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) that incorporate in situ measurements from ships and buoys.

future-of-the-electricity-system-in-the-gcc-countries;;;;Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates;EMEA;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Future of the Electricity System in the GCC Countries;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this project is to understand how policy can expedite renewable energy transitions in a cost-effective way, while allowing competitive national industries to develop. In line with this objective, a wide range of policy instruments, designed and implemented to promote renewable energy, are being assessed. Furthermore, the project takes a holistic approach by analyzing how the competitive dynamics between renewable technologies and incumbent technologies evolve. </p>
<p>In addition, the project focuses on how new technologies in distributed energy resources (DER) are transforming customer/provider relationships. Advances in distributed generation technologies and associated cost reductions are providing customers with potentially attractive alternatives to standard electric utility services, perhaps turning them into ‘prosumers’. Utilities around the world are re-evaluating their business models, and regulators are considering multiple market reforms. The project aims to develop analytical tools and techniques to help address the key market, regulatory and energy policy issues in a power sector with high penetration of DER.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Global electricity markets are facing substantial changes from both the demand and supply side of the industry. These structural shifts are also affecting Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which need to adapt by developing new electricity models. Moving to a new power system will require significant reforms in the Gulf states. These countries may have to transform: state-run companies to private entities, monopolies to competitive markets, fossil fuel generation to a diversified electricity mix and from regulated to liberalized prices.</p>
<p>Renewable energy can be an economical option to diversify a country’s existing electricity mix. Recent tenders for solar photovoltaic (PV) suggest that renewable technology is competitive or, at least, they confirm that renewables can compete successfully under certain conditions. </p>
<p>As the current business model of pricing electricity, which is based on the marginal cost of production, is becoming obsolete, new models must emerge; and one example is the use of markets that value reliability and flexibility of electricity supply.</p>
<p>Electricity reform efforts in the GCC might incorporate three important characteristics. First, a credible economic plan with a rational time schedule to develop the regulations needed to achieve stated objectives. Second, price and subsidy reform to ensure long-term viability. Third, renewable energy to be added to the generation portfolio, while natural gas can act as the most effective back up to the system.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop Series, LOCE, PV;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-05-10T13:22:42+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:51+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/KS-2017-WB03-Future-of-the-Electricity-System-in-GCC-Countries-.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2017-05-10;2017-05-10;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 <strong>About the Project</strong>
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to understand the context of China’s energy economy and underlying decisionmaking processes. This understanding will enable the collection of relevant and accurate data both to feed analysis and drive the interpretation of model outputs. The project aims to analyze and assess information to obtain policy relevant insights. Its focus is on investigating the global consequences of changes to energy markets within China and China’s energy policies. In line with KAPSARC’s overall objectives, the aim is to produce policy relevant insights that may assist actors outside China to understand the consequences of decisions taken by actors in China.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Key Points</strong>
</p>
<p>
During periods of supply abundance that lead to lower prices, commodity exporters strive to secure their market share with major importing economies. This paper seeks to cast light on what drives an exporter’s share of Chinese imports of oil, gas and coal – and we find that the strategy behind achieving this goal need not rely on pricing policies alone. China has been promoting a trade agenda that seeks to strengthen economic ties in the Asia-Pacific region and has been extending negotiations aimed at developing relationships worldwide. The country is a major energy import powerhouse; its trade deals have significant impact on the international energy trade and global energy markets. We explore the role of energy in China’s preferential trade agreements (PTAs) and extend the trade gravity model to disaggregated trade flows, estimating the impact these agreements have on Chinese energy imports. We find that: Securing energy/resource imports is not the major driver of China’s PTA strategy. Other considerations include: access to significant or strategically important markets, complementary economic and trade structures and extending political influence. The impact of PTAs on trade patterns varies across product groups. Agreement elements may include tariff reduction, scope and other specific policy arrangements. From China’s perspective, reduced import tariff rates likely:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Increase the import flows of coal, crude oil and oil products – but not gas – from a partner economy to China.
 </li>
<li>Help an energy exporter increase its share in Chinese crude oil and oil product imports.
 </li>

<li>Divert a partner’s exports of crude oil and oil products to China from competing importers.
 </li>

</ul>
<p>From an exporter’s perspective, the presence of an operational PTA with China likely:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Increases the import flows of gas from a partner economy to China.
 </li>
<li>Helps an energy exporter increase its share of Chinese imports of coal.
 </li>
<li>Diverts a partner’s exports of coal and gas to China from other importers.
 </li>

<li>Does not affect oil exports to China.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The depth and scope of a PTA does not affect the patterns of Chinese energy imports.

<p>Increasing energy productivity holds some of the greatest possibilities for enhancing the welfare countries get out of their energy systems. It also recasts energy efficiency in terms of boosting competitiveness and wealth, more powerfully conveying its profound benefits to society. KAPSARC and UNESCWA have initiated this project to explore the energy productivity potential of the Arab region, starting with the six GCC countries and later extending to other countries. Aimed at policymakers, this project highlights the social gains from energy productivity investments, where countries are currently at, and pathways to achieving improved performance in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>More than 75 percent of the total electricity consumed in Oman is attributed to buildings, with almost 50 percent used by households. The absence of mandatory energy efficiency regulations for buildings, coupled with population growth, has led to a significant increase in annual energy consumption and peak power demand in the country – both averaging growth rates of 10 percent over the last five years. We used an energy productivity analysis approach to analyze the benefits of large-scale energy efficiency programs in new and existing buildings. Our study finds:</p>
<p>Investment in energy efficiency measures to retrofit existing buildings could lead to significant economic and environmental benefits. The potential for energy savings will vary depending on implementation costs and scale of retrofits. The benefits that can be realized for residential buildings are significantly higher than those obtained for commercial or governmental buildings.</p>
<p>If a minimal Level-1 energy retrofit program is applied to existing residential buildings, savings of 957 GWh/year in electricity consumption and 214 MW in peak power demand can be achieved. Moreover, if a Level-3 deep retrofit of energy efficiency measures is implemented for the residential sector, savings soar to 6,000 GWh/year in electricity consumption and 1,300 MW in peak power demand. Also, 4 million metric tonnes per year of carbon emissions will be eliminated. </p>
<p>A Level-3 retrofit of the entire building stock in Oman can result in savings of 10,000 GWh/year in electricity consumption and 2,300 MW in peak power demand. Additionally, there would be a 7 million metric tonnes per year of reduction in carbon emissions</p>
<p>The economic impact of the buildings' energy efficiency retrofit program is the potential to create new employment in Oman. The direct effects for retrofitting buildings include jobs needed to implement energy efficiency measures while the indirect effects are associated with work needed to produce and supply energy efficiency equipment and materials.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, Energy Efficiency, Building;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-05-22T13:22:41+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:50+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/KS-2017-DP11-Energy-Productivity-Evaluating-Large-Scale-Building-Energy-Efficiency-Programs-in-Oman.pdf;0;Kankana Dubey, Moncef Krarti;;;;;;;2017-05-22;2017-05-22;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

 <strong>About the Project</strong>
</p>
<p>KAPSARC is developing the KAPSARC Toolkit for Behavioral Analysis (KTAB), an open source software platform, to support modeling and analysis of collective decisionmaking processes (CDMPs). KTAB is intended to be the standard platform for analyzing bargaining problems, generalized voting models, and policy decision-making. It is our intent to use KTAB to assemble the building blocks for a broad class of CDMPs. Typical models in KTAB will draw on the insights of subject matter experts regarding decision makers and influencers in a methodical, consistent manner; and then assist researchers to identify feasible outcomes that are the result of CDMPs.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>The traditional economic approach to policy analysis is to utilize tools and methods developed within the field of economics and study the economic impact of one or more policies solely from an economic perspective. As a consequence, the “policies” are usually formulated and evaluated only by an assessment of the pure economic optimality of expected outcomes. Moreover, economic models typically treat policy choices as exogenously specified. Once policies are selected according to some exogenous process, then scenario analysis can be performed to simulate the economic impact of those policies.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, explicit research into the policymaking process – and in particular models of the policymaking process, tend to oversimplify or ignore the economic outcomes of the policies debated among policymakers. In particular, modelers of what we broadly classify as collective decision making processes (CDMPs) – in other words, models that capture the process of political choice – tend to utilize simple, fixed models of economics, if any economic consideration is taken into account at all. The economic consequences, or the outcomes, of choices of actors are generally treated as the end points of models. The implications of policy choices, once arrived at, are typically left unexplored.
</p>

<p>Either approach in isolation misses out on important interactions between political and economic phenomena. The economically optimal policy is rarely the option selected, and is often not even under consideration because of political considerations. Policies that may appear to be politically appealing at first blush can lose their charm once adopted, because of the economic impact upon attempts to implement them. In this paper, we argue that politics and economics are inextricably intertwined, and can be modeled as such. We develop a hybrid quantitative model of economics and CDMPs that allows us to capture the process of policymaking based on utilities derived from an endogenous economic model.
</p>

<p>We develop this model with the KAPSARC Toolkit
for Behavioral Analysis (KTAB), which is an open
source platform for building CDMP models. All
KTAB models represent stochastic decision-making
among comparatively small numbers of actors or
stakeholder groups – more than one, but less than
hundreds – within the paradigm of Probabilistic
Condorcet Elections (PCE). Even in formal voting
situations, such as in government or boardrooms,
informal influence-based negotiation is truly what
drives voting – an obvious example of this is
lobbyists influencing U.S. senators – so we need a
negotiation model that captures this behavior. The
PCE is a general framework for modeling this type
of informal policymaking process; this framework is
extremely flexible, and lacks restrictive assumptions
present in others.

</p>

<p>
In this paper, to demonstrate our approach, we develop a CDMP based on the PCE, in which actors represent sectors in a Leontief economy. Each actor negotiates and forms coalitions so as to maximize its (the actor’s) utility. The data we used are synthesized from real data representing nine sectors and three actors of production in the U.S. economy from 1981. Applied to these data, our model demonstrates that strategically sophisticated economic policies can be generated using an integrated CDMP framework.

 <strong>About the Project</strong></p><p>Since the oil price shocks of the 1970s, the security of oil supply has been the main concern in academic and policy circles. The goal of this research project is to study the other side of the coin — the security of oil demand from the net-exporters perspective. How do large oil exporters trade off risk and rewards in ensuring security of demand? In the first phase of this research project, a comparative static model of global oil trade is developed to empirically measure the impacts of alternative crude oil market shares across segmented markets; to assess the strategic choice NOCs have in valuing alternative sales market portfolios in the context of the trade-off along the risk-reward frontier; and to compare IOC behavior as a benchmark for NOCs.</p><p>More specifically, this project will attempt to specify a parsimonious model of regionally segmented global oil trade calibrated to 2012 benchmark data which would allow comparative static exercises to simulate equilibrium impacts of alternative placement of term-contracted crude oil, including impacts on total revenues for crude oil producers. The model focuses on three fundamental variables that determine relative crude oil prices: transport costs, crude oil quality, and refinery flexibility</p><p>In line with KAPSARC’s overall objectives, the intent is to produce policy-relevant insights that help actors in the oil industry understand the consequences of decisions taken by large exporters. </p><p>The workshop series fits into the overall project by providing a continuing dialogue that raises key issues, provides feedback on current work, and sets future directions. The workshops are an open collaborative forum that enables the discussion of particular themes that feed into identified research questions.</p><p>
 <strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>When oil owned and commercially traded by an exporting country is stored in an importing country in exchange for first drawing rights by the host country in times of emergency, that process is known as ‘joint oil stockpiling’. It can thus be classified as both commercial and strategic storage, offering benefits to both parties. The first Middle East (ME)–Northeast Asia (NEA) joint stockpiling deal was concluded in 2006 between Kuwait and South Korea. Since then there have been several similar agreements by which the national oil companies (NOCs) of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE have stored crude in in South Korea and Japan. An accord between the UAE and India, concluded in December 2016, is the most recent example</p><p>The unique character of the joint oil stockpiling agreements between ME exporters and the NEA importers means these can meet two objectives simultaneously:</p><ul>
 
<li>The perceived energy security needs of net oil-importing countries and their objectives of enhancing their respective strategic petroleum reserves at low cost. This is because the oil-importing country does not purchase crude oil up front, but retains the pre-emptive right to purchase the oil in case of an oil disruption emergency.</li><li>By obtaining free or cheap storage facilities within close proximity to large consuming countries, ME NOCs can take advantage of the flexibility provided by effectively having short-haul crude on offer to both their term contract clients and to other crude oil refiners that are not term clients. Joint oil stockpiling offers a platform for opportunistic access of Asian spot markets, an important consideration for the ME NOCs in the current low oil price environment.</li></ul><p>Assuming a crude oil price of around $40/barrel (bbl), 5 percent interest cost of carry and an equal division of the carrying cost savings with the host government, the ME NOC could gain $9 to $18 million a year if it enjoyed 50 percent of the cost savings in storing 15-30 million barrels (MMbbl). </p><p>The host NEA country saves about $2.00/bbl in carrying costs while retaining the pre-emptive right to buy the stored oil during oil supply emergencies. If 15-30 MMbbl are stored, the NEA country would save an estimated $31.5 million to $63 million per year</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, joint oil stockpiling;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-06-01T07:01:07+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:49+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/KS-2017-DP06-Joint-Oil-Stockpiling-between-Middle-East-Exporters-and-Northeast-Asian-Importers.pdf;0;Tilak Doshi, Sammy Six;;;;;;;2017-06-01;2017-06-01;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>China, the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, is taking steps to combat the effects of climate change on its environment. The path it takes to mitigate the effects of pollution will have a significant impact on the global carbon reduction agenda. In this study, we focus on the political feasibility of implementing a carbon tax in China within the next five years. We do this using the KAPSARC Toolkit for Behavioral Analysis (KTAB) platform, a model of collective decision-making processes (CDMPs) developed at KAPSARC to assess the expected support in China for, and reactions to, this potential policy choice. Our key findings are as follows:</p>
<p>The majority of Chinese actors are expected to view as positive the application of a weak carbon tax. A tough, clearly articulated and enforceable carbon tax, however, does not appear to be politically feasible in the current Chinese context.</p>
<p>Large energy companies, particularly heavy carbon emitters, may oppose the principle of a carbon tax, but recognize the need to engage in the policy discussion to help shape any potential outcome.</p>
<p>Momentum behind a carbon tax in China is slow but steady. Even if energy companies have substantial political clout and are able to disrupt progress on a carbon tax, this would not be sufficient to derail the weak but growing consensus that favors some form of tax on carbon.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, Toolkit, Behavioral Analysis, Carbon,  Emissions;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-06-01T13:22:40+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:49+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KS-2017-DP025-Restructuring-Saudi-Arabiaâ€™s-Power-Generation-Sector-Model-Based-Insights.pdf;0;Imtenan Al-Mubarak, Brian Efird, Leo Lester, Sun Xia;;;;;;;2017-12-20;2017-12-20;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), buildings consume almost 90 percent of the total electricity used in the country, mostly in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. We undertook a study to explore available opportunities to improve the energy efficiency of the UAE building sector. This paper assesses the best combinations of energy efficiency measures that can be adopted at a minimal cost. In our simulation, we evaluated a series of energy efficiency options for both existing and new buildings. Our optimization analysis is based on the sequential search technique, applied to a wide range of applications, including combinations of energy efficient measures (EEMs) and retrofitting existing buildings. Our findings are:</p>
<p>Any level of energy efficiency retrofit to existing UAE building stock would achieve significant savings. It is estimated that deep retrofits have the potential to reduce the energy consumption of existing buildings by up to 50 percent.</p>
<p>It is estimated that a basic energy retrofit program applied to existing UAE building stock could achieve savings of 7,550 GWh/year in electricity consumption, 1,400 MW in peak electricity demand and reduce carbon emissions by 4.5 million tons/year. The scheme would have an average payback period of less than six months for the UAE government. </p>
<p>Our optimization analyses reveal that deployment of a large-scale energy retrofit program for the UAE building stock would be cost-effective for the government. A deep retrofit of the entire building stock would have a payback period of just 2.3 years, yielding significant benefits: saving about 47,200 GWh/ year in electricity consumption together with 8,802 MW in peak power demand and reducing 28.5 million tons/year of carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Realizing this value, Dubai has already created a super ESCO (Etihad Energy Services) to finance and jump-start retrofit projects of existing buildings using the performance contracting concept, a means of financing energy efficiency investments that is based on future savings. In March 2017, the Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority and the UAE Ministry of Economy launched an ESCO in Abu Dhabi. This scheme could be extended to the other emirates.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, Energy, Efficiency, Building;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-06-08T07:01:06+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:48+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/KS-2017-DP013-Economic-and-Environmental-Benefits-of-Improving-UAE-Building-Stock-Energy-Efficiency.pdf;0;Kankana Dubey, Moncef Krarti;;;;;;;2017-06-08;2017-06-08;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
curbing-carbon-emission-is-a-carbon-tax-the-most-efficient-levy;;;;World;WORLD;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Curbing Carbon Emission: Is a Carbon Tax the Most Efficient Levy;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this research is to understand how different policy tools could expedite the transition toward a low-carbon economy in a cost-effective manner. This project takes a pragmatic approach to climate change policies, recognizing the need to balance the economic and environmental impacts of these policies. Ignoring the cost of these policies could not only create a substantial economic burden but also lead to a loss of social mandate. This is one of the greatest risks to the successful implementation of sound climate change policy, which by its nature requires clear and predictable government commitment over the long-term.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>The ambitious environmental objectives of the Paris Agreement imply that, in order to curb carbon emissions, all cost-effective policy options should be considered. These options include carbon taxes, probably the most popular fiscal tool for curbing emissions, and various other taxes on fossil fuels. This study uses Spanish data to assess what are the optimal taxes on oil, natural gas and coal from a welfare perspective, and compares them with a carbon tax in a general equilibrium context. The results of the analysis are as follows:</p>
<p>Among their options for reducing CO2 emissions, policymakers may consider taxing coal heavily. Less punitive taxation of oil and natural gas could also form part of an optimal strategy.</p>
<p>For maximum effectiveness, we found that any planned tax on oil should always be lower than the tax on natural gas, and still lower than that on coal. This counterintuitive result comes about because oil has the highest marginal economic productivity of the three fuels, though natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel in terms of CO2 emissions. According to standard economic theory, the marginal economic productivity of any fossil fuel should be similar to international prices for it in competitive markets.</p>
<p>Carbon tax has both advantages and disadvantages for policymakers. In the short run, the revenue collected would be higher from an optimal mixture of taxes on the various fossil fuels – but, in the longer term, higher taxes might be seen by taxpayers as unreasonable and could result in a loss of support for the environmental policies they are intended to underpin.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, CO2,  Emissions, Fossil fuel;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-06-15T13:22:38+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:48+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/KS-2017-DP017-Curbing-Carbon-Emissions-Is-a-Carbon-Tax-the-Most-Efficient-Levy-.pdf;0;Jorge Blazquez, Jose Martin-Moreno;;;;;;;2017-06-15;2017-06-15;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
estimating-the-learning-curve-of-solar-pv-balance-of-systems-for-over-20-countri;;;;World;WORLD;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Estimating the Learning Curve of Solar PV Balance-of-Systems for Over 20 Countries;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>Although the costs of solar modules have fallen precipitously and have, thus far, followed an 80% learning curve, balance-of-system (BOS) costs have not declined at the same rate. Today, the BOS represents the majority of the capital costs for solar installations. The growing share of BOS in the total cost of solar systems has direct implications on its competitiveness.</p>
<p>For the first time, and with the aid of an extensive dataset, learning curves of the BOS component for residential systems have been deduced for over 20 countries. In addition to computing a global average for BOS learning at 89%, this modeling exercise showed that there are a number of cost reduction opportunities that exist in the BOS segment, and these require no (or little) financial policy support.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>The capital cost of a solar photovoltaic (PV) system comprises the module and balance-of-systems (BOS). The latter refers to everything else that is needed to make the solar system functional including cables, mounts, labor, etc. While modules are priced internationally, the BOS is countryspecific. Price developments of modules, which have been thoroughly studied in literature, followed an 80 percent learning</p>
<p>The LC for BOS in residential PV systems is estimated for more than 20 countries via an extensive dataset. We show that the BOS LCs for these countries are typically lower than that of modules, affirming the few single-country studies reported previously.</p>
<p>Our calculations yielded a global LC for the BOS of 89 percent, which corresponds to a progress ratio of 11 percent compared with 20 percent for modules. </p>
<p>The data was then divided into two periods – pre- and post-2008 – to study the effects of the global financial crisis on LC development. It was found that many countries were able to sustain progress in the LC post-2008 despite reduced financial policy support, indicating that there are effective steps that could be taken by policymakers to reduce BOS costs without requiring (significant) financial policy support.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, PV;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-06-15T13:22:38+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:48+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/KS-2017-DP015-Estimating-the-Learning-Curve-of-Solar-PV-Balance-of-Systems-for-over-20-countries.pdf;0;Amro Elshurafa, Shahad Albardi, Carlo Andrea Bollino, Simona Bigerna;;;;;;;2017-06-15;2017-06-15;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is a partial equilibrium model formulated as a mixed complementarity problem to capture the administered prices that permeate the local economy.

The passenger transportation model presented in this paper helps understand more of the end-use energy demand.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>In 2016, policymakers in Saudi Arabia increased domestic transportation fuel prices, which are expected to approach market levels in the near future. Current low crude oil prices offer an excellent opportunity for policymakers to deregulate the passenger transportation sector without a significant change in local fuel prices. We developed a bottom-up transportation sub-model and integrated it with the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM) to assess whether consumers could afford such reforms; and the resulting travel mode choices, energy consumption levels and revenue. We do not consider price-induced efficiency improvements; hence, the results would represent an upper bound for the shift to public modes.</p><p>Despite a deregulation of the passenger transportation sector, Saudi households would continue to allocate one of the lowest transport budgets (as a percentage of income) in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and also stay within Saudi Arabian historical boundaries.</p><p>Deregulating fuel prices would encourage consumers to travel by more efficient public transport modes, as they become available in the near future, leading to significant energy savings and CO2 emissions reductions of between 4 million to 26 million metric tons (mt) per year.</p><p>The Kingdom would receive an annual average $8.2 billion as additional revenue from domestic sales and exports in the varying crude price scenario and $5 billion in the fixed $60/bbl scenario.</p><p>Despite the increase in transport fuel price, the net gain for Saudi Arabia in the varying crude oil price scenario remains positive as a result of substantial increase in revenue and the introduction of more convenient public travel modes.</p><p>Our findings show that analyzing energy policies using empirical estimates are generally valid even for large variations in price; however, if new transport modes and technologies are introduced in Saudi Arabia, consumer response may be slightly greater than that of empirical estimate, which did not account for such new modes.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper , KEM;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-07-09T13:22:37+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:47+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/KS-2017-DP012-Impact-of-Domestic-Fuel-Price-Reforms-on-the-use-of-Public-Transport.pdf;0;Ibrahim Algunaibet;;;;;;;2017-07-09;2017-07-09;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>Increasing energy productivity holds some of the greatest possibilities for enhancing the welfare countries get out of their energy systems. It also recasts energy efficiency in terms of boosting competitiveness and wealth, more powerfully conveying its profound benefits to society. KAPSARC and UNESCWA have initiated this project to explore the energy productivity potential of the Arab region, starting with the six GCC countries and later extending to other countries. Aimed at policymakers, this project highlights the social gains from energy productivity investments, where countries are currently at, and pathways to achieving improved performance in this area.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>This paper describes our analysis of the cost-effectiveness of designing and retrofitting residential buildings in Bahrain and outlines our analytical approach. The study focuses on residential buildings since households consume more than 48 percent of electricity used in the country. As expected, residential buildings constitute the vast majority of Bahrain’s building stock, with about 76 percent of the total and projected annual growth in energy consumption of around 3 percent in the next few years.</p>
<p>The optimization analysis outlined in this paper assesses the potential benefits from retrofitting both individual buildings and the entire national building stock, as well as the benefits of applying proven measures and technologies to improve the energy efficiency of the building sector. Our conclusions are:</p>
<p>The development and enforcement of a more stringent energy efficiency code can potentially improve the energy efficiency of the new building stock with a reduction of more than 320 GWh in annual electricity consumption and 87 MW in peak demand.</p>
<p>Retrofitting the existing building stock in Bahrain has the potential to cost-effectively reduce energy consumption in the building sector by 62 percent, with a 55 percent reduction in peak electricity demand compared with the business as usual scenario. The avoided costs of building new power plants would be sufficient to offset the implementation costs for a basic level of energy retrofitting of existing residential buildings.</p>
<p>We estimate that as much as 31,700 job-years of employment can be created when retrofitting the existing building stock. More than 3,000 jobs would be needed annually in order to retrofit existing buildings over a 10-year period.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper , Energy efficiency, Building;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-07-16T13:22:37+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:47+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/KS-2017-DP016-An-Evaluation-of-High-Energy-Performance-Residential-Buildings-in-Bahrain.pdf;0;Kankana Dubey, Moncef Krarti;;;;;;;2017-07-16;2017-07-16;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
drivers-of-transportation-fuel-demand-fuel-efficient-mobility-from-the-consumers;;;;World;WORLD;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Economic Cycles and the Responsiveness of Natural Gas Demand in Chinaâ€™s Residential Sector;"<p><strong>About the Project </strong></p>
<p>The workshop series Drivers of Transportation Fuel Demand provides a forum for discussing key sustainability issues in transportation and current policy strategies to address them. In particular, much emphasis is placed on the adoption of fuelefficient and alternative-fuel vehicles for road transportation, innovation in fuel and vehicle technology mixes and the shift from road to other modes of transportation.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>The working assumption of most policymakers and automakers is that light-duty vehicle buyers either undervalue fuel economy or behave as if they do – perhaps because of the complexity in evaluating discounted fuel cost savings. If one accepts this argument then huge benefits can be gained from public policies that mandate fuel-efficient mobility through performance standards. </p>

<p>Increasing vehicle fuel economy at the expense of performance has an opportunity cost for consumers as they value performance more than fuel economy. However, it remains an open question as to whether public policy, such as fuel economy standards, should incorporate opportunity costs arising from consumers’ tendency to maximize personal over societal benefit. </p>

<p>Consumer concerns over the adoption of high fuel economy plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) centers around driving range, recharging time, charging infrastructure, value for money and highway performance, which continue to be major barriers. Evidence suggests that awareness and knowledge about PEVs have not yet increased substantially in many consumer segments. Finding better ways for consumers to gain firsthand experience with PEVs may help overcome this knowledge shortfall. </p>

<p>Short-term incentives to induce PEV sales are expensive; more than $50,000 per incremental vehicle sold according to some estimates. There is scope to improve cost-effectiveness by developing a targeted incentive structure. Alternatively, devoting resources to technology development rather than deployment might represent a more cost-effective policy approach. </p>

<p>Shared use of automated electric vehicles represents one possible path for achieving deep decarbonization, but its cost-effectiveness versus alternative paths has yet to be confirmed. PEVs seem unlikely to succeed if they are just a decarbonized replacement for today’s vehicles, but this can be achieved if they provide a better customer experience at a lower price point. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop Series;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-07-19T13:22:36+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:47+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/KS-2018-DP29-Economic-Cycles-and-the-Responsiveness-of-Natural-Gas-Demand-in-Chinaâ€™s-Residential-Sector.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2018-03-05;2018-03-05;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>This paper draws on KAPSARC’s energy productivity work focused on how shifting to a growth model based around higher energy productivity can benefit Saudi Arabia and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Energy productivity is both a policy agenda focusing on how energy can best be used to create value in the economy, and an indicator which integrates economic growth with energy consumption. At the macroeconomic level, energy productivity describes how much GDP can be produced using an amount of energy. It is the mathematical inverse of energy intensity and is both a reflection of what activities energy is used for (the structural make-up for the economy), and how well energy is used in specific activities (the level of energy efficiency). At the microeconomic level energy productivity focuses on how much revenue is produced from economic activities per unit of energy consumption. This is related but distinct from energy efficiency which focuses on how much physical output is produced per unit of energy consumption. KAPSARC has partnered with UNESCWA to explore the energy productivity potential of Saudi Arabia and the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and will release a synthesis report of this work later in 2017. </p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>A common priority across G20 countries is the need to reinvigorate economies through an economic transformation that delivers a higher level of better quality growth. At KAPSARC, the need to improve economic growth and deliver climate goals agreed at COP21 in Paris is being investigated using an energy productivity framework, or how greater value can be obtained from the energy system for each unit of energy consumed. </p>
<p>Energy productivity is an economic planning tool that is increasingly being used in G20 countries to help achieve sustainable development goals. Its key elements are structural change towards higher value added economic activities and improving energy efficiency. </p>
<p>A focus on lifting productivity across the economy aligns naturally with the need to lift overall economic productivity, which is the main long-term driver of growth.</p>
<p>Faced with the current extended period of weak international growth and low commodity prices, Saudi Arabia has intensified diversification efforts aimed at more sustained and sustainable economic development. </p>
<p>Key elements of the diversification strategy involve boosting private sector investment and improving business conditions; a significant fiscal stimulus to households and industry; increasing energy prices to help diversify government revenue and support structural change and energy efficiency in the economy; and increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix. </p>
<p>Such pro-growth measures to realign the Saudi economy towards a higher-value added, more energy efficient economy will lift the Kingdom’s energy productivity and contribute to achieving its Nationally Determined Commitment to avoid 130 million tons of CO2-e as set out at COP21 in Paris. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, Energy Productivity;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-07-31T13:22:35+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:47+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/KS-2017-DP014-R1-Growth-Investment-and-the-Low-Carbon-Transition-A-View-From-KSA.pdf;0;Ibrahim Abdel Gelil, Nicholas Howarth, Alessandro Lanza;;;;;;;2017-07-31;2017-07-31;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

drivers-of-transportation-shared-automated-mobility-on-demand;;;;World;WORLD;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Drivers of Transportation: Shared Automated Mobility-On-Demand;"<p><strong>About the Project </strong></p>
<p>The workshop series Drivers of Transportation Fuel Demand provides a forum for discussing key sustainability issues in transportation and current policy strategies to address them. In particular, much emphasis is placed on the adoption of fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel vehicles for road transportation, innovation in fuel and vehicle technology mixes and mobility-on-demand.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>

<p>Major transformations are taking place in the mobility sector; where a transportation system comprising of shared, fully electric, connected and driverless cars available on demand may be on the cusp of emergence. Technological developments and preferences of the next generation toward pay-per-use mobility instead of owning a vehicle is leading this innovation. </p>

<p>Mobility-on-demand could critically alter key aspects of travel behavior such as vehicle ownership, miles traveled and use of mass transit; potentially causing major changes in the automotive and energy sector. </p>
<p>Enhanced personal mobility and economic gains from mobility-on-demand are expected to affect societal welfare — impacting energy demand, greenhouse gas emission, alternative fuel vehicle adoption and congestion. The outcome depends on whether it replaces mass transit or personal driving, which will decide if there is an increase or decrease in vehicle miles traveled. </p>

<p>Satisfying consumer needs and delivering financial and social value would lead the future evolution, underlining the importance of understanding mobility from a consumer’s perspective. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop Series, Mobility-on-demand;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-08-03T13:22:35+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:46+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/KS-2017-WB05-Drivers-of-Transportation-Fuel-Demand-Shared-Automated-Mobility-on-Demand.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2017-08-03;2017-08-03;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

sheltering-the-economies-of-oil-exporting-countries-from-energy-shocks;;;;World;WORLD;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Sheltering the Economies of Oil-Exporting Countries From Energy Shocks;"<p><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">Key Points</strong></p><p>Price shocks are a feature of international oil markets, with the oil price collapse in the second half of 2014 being the most recent example. These episodes are a source of macroeconomic disruption that harm economic activity in the short and medium term, particularly for oil-exporting countries. </p><p>The recent emergence of non-conventional oil – such as light, tight oil – represents a critical change in oil markets. Investments in non-conventional oil react very aggressively to changes in oil prices, impacting the structure of oil markets, and could reduce volatility in the future.</p><p>Three approaches to stabilizing the economies of exporting countries can provide different ways of achieving specific objectives: </p><p>Sovereign wealth funds, which invest current oil and gas revenues in long-term assets so as to increase future economic welfare, are the most widely used strategy. In particular, stabilization funds essentially boost savings from oil revenues in good times, when prices are high, so these can be released through increased expenditures to stimulate the economy during bad times, such as during a price shock. The type of fund and investment strategy to be used depends on the policy objectives and time horizons. </p><p>Economic diversification addresses the reality that oil-exporting countries tend to have their producing sector concentrated in oil and oil-related activities. Diversification is a way to reduce the resulting gross domestic product (GDP) volatility. In the case of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, it appears that higher growth with lower volatility could be achieved by increasing the share of the manufacturing sector in the countries’ GDP, while reducing the shares of services and oil and gas.</p><p>Diversifying the energy mix of the GCC would not, by itself, reduce oil-fueled volatility in the economy. It would reduce domestic consumption of oil and gas and permit increased exports. Stabilization, though, will only be brought about by diverting these funds to broader economic diversification or increasing the size of stabilization funds. Otherwise, higher exports would also increase the countries’ exposure to oil price shocks. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop Series, Oil Shock, Oil-Exporting;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-08-10T13:22:34+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:46+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/KS-2017-WB06-Sheltering-the-Economies-of-Oil-Exporting-Countries-From-Energy-Shocks.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2017-08-10;2017-08-10;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

measuring-the-capabilities-of-firms-to-deliver-local-content-in-resource-rich-co;;;;World;WORLD;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Measuring the Capabilities of Firms to Deliver Local Content in Resource Rich Countries;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>Natural Resource-led Development in New Producing Countries</p>
<p>Our project seeks to understand how natural resource extraction can drive inclusive economic growth in new producing countries. We are engaged in a multiyear, multidisciplinary study with four objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the human geography of new producing countries. </li>
<li> Assess the magnitude of new discoveries and estimate direct fiscal impact. </li>
<li>Understand how industry can be localized to create economic growth. </li>
<li>Estimate spillovers and welfare impacts to society. </li>
</ul>
<p>We recognize that policymaking in new producing countries is a complex process, and our project also seeks to understand the interactions of actors’ interests that drive energy sector policies.</p>
<p>Our initial focus is on four countries – Kenya, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda – that expect to develop significant oil and gas reserves in the next 5-7 years. Through natural resource development, these countries hope to achieve middle-income economic status by 2030-2040. This project is conducted through close collaboration with leading think tanks and NGOs in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>The term ‘Local Content Policy’ is a catch-all for ensuring that resource owners capture more value from developments than the fiscal revenues alone. KAPSARC has explained the benefits of a dynamic perspective when evaluating firms’ capabilities – their entrepreneurial capacity – and proposed a tool for assessing firms in this paradigm. Here, we present an analysis based on the descriptive statistics gathered from applying the framework outlined in the previous two papers</p>
<p>Uganda is on the cusp of developing its oil industry following major discoveries around Lake Albert in the northwest region of the country. It has provided a useful case study for developing insights that can be more generally applied in resource rich economies seeking to maximize the value extracted from their endowments. KAPSARC conducted a study of Ugandan firms, their capabilities and potential to serve the oil and gas industry as suppliers. The specific findings were:</p>
<p>Ugandan firms demonstrate relatively good performance in some important dimensions, including absorptive capacity and innovation. However, this is curbed by low levels of linkages with the academic and industrial sectors, limited exports and poor interaction with the financial sector</p>
<p>The firms surveyed show an entrepreneurial behavior, which is encouraging for public policies promoting the private sector. Moreover, almost all the firms are privately owned.</p>
<p>International standards, important in oil and gas operations, are not widely used. Plugging this gap is an opportunity that can be addressed by local content policies.</p>
<p>The oil and gas industry is new in Uganda, yet 29 percent of the firms surveyed are already suppliers to the sector. The contribution to their sales represents only a small percentage. This low level of sales among a relatively high number of suppliers indicates a potentially positive impact on the local supply chain if appropriate local content policies are designed. </p>";KAPSARC Publications; Discussion paper, Local Content;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-08-13T13:22:34+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:46+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/KS-2017-DP019-Measuring-the-Capabilities-of-Firms-to-Deliver-Local-Content-in-Resource-Rich-Countries.pdf;0;Marcelo Neuman, Roger Tissot, Daniel Mabrey;;;;;;;2017-08-13;2017-08-13;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reforming-industrial-fuel-and-residential-electricity-prices-in-saudi-arabia;;;;Saudi Arabia;EMEA;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Reforming Industrial Fuel and Residential Electricity Prices in Saudi Arabia;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>We developed the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM) for Saudi Arabia to understand the dynamics of the country’s energy system. It is a partial equilibrium model formulated as a mixed complementarity problem to capture the administered prices that permeate the local economy. KEM has been previously used to study the impacts of various industrial fuel pricing policies, improved residential energy efficiency on the energy economy, the feasibility of installing coal-fired power plants in Saudi Arabia, and to computationally analyze residential time-of-use electricity tariffs. In the present paper, we apply the model to look at the demand response of households in Saudi Arabia to changing electricity prices.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>The Saudi electricity sector buys fuel and sells electricity at prices administered by the government. In this analysis, we assume that fuel prices are deregulated — priced at their marginal values or international equivalents — and use a long-term static version of the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM) for Saudi Arabia. This allows a better understanding of the economic effects of energy price reform packages by providing illustrative estimates of their impacts. We do not propose a specific package of reforms, but seek to show the different channels by which the Saudi economy can benefit. </p>
<p>We expand on previous KAPSARC analyses by combining the price reform of fuels used in power plants with the implementation of alternative electricity pricing schemes for households. In particular, we examine the differences between ‘lifeline’, average-cost and marginal-cost electricity pricing policies for residential customers. </p>
<p>Compared with business as usual (a scenario replicating the year 2015), we find: </p>
<p>Energy system-wide benefits of nearly $4 billion per year could be achieved by deregulating fuel input prices, valuing the oil saved at the 2015 average world oil price. Most of these benefits stem from the ability to export more crude oil than otherwise would have been the case. </p>
<p>The total gain to the energy system, however, increases to $12 billion per year by raising electricity prices to households to reflect the cost of supply. Much of this gain is due to the decline in electricity consumption in response to the higher prices. </p>
<p>Without any mitigation for the lowest income households, these consumers would pay an additional $3 billion in electricity costs. However, lifeline prices would halve this burden while maintaining greater economic gains than by only deregulating fuel input prices. </p>
<p>The average electricity price paid under the lifeline scenario would be a more manageable 4.0 cents per kWh, versus an average marginal-cost price of 7.1 cents per kWh, and an average cost price of 7.70 cents per kWh. </p>
<p>In the alternative electricity pricing scenarios we study, natural gas usage by the power utilities falls, allowing gas to flow to other industries, which would consume it to reduce their costs. We find the marginal values of natural gas falling at higher electricity prices, indicating that the supply of gas is becoming less constrained. In these scenarios, lower fuel consumption and investment costs contribute to the policies’ gains. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-08-29T13:22:33+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:45+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/KS-2017-DP018-Reforming-Industrial-Fuel-and-Residential-Electricity-Prices-in-Saudi-Arabia.pdf;0;Murad Anwer, Walid Matar;;;;;;;2017-08-29;2017-08-29;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
transitioning-to-liberalized-energy-markets;;;;Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates;EMEA;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Transitioning to Liberalized Energy Markets;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>The workshop series Energy System Modeling provides a forum to discuss the role of models in formulating and analyzing energy policies. The workshop series has been focusing on timely themes that are both technical and policy-relevant. Insights from these workshops are expected to help foster a common understanding among creators and consumers of models, enriching our future research direction.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Some countries have successfully navigated the transition to using a free market to provide energy more efficiently, while others are only just embarking on this journey. This transition is a lengthy, costly and complex process. Consequently, lessons learned from their experiences can help improve policy formulation in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries that are themselves at various stages of the reform process. KAPSARC’s workshop focused on the electricity sector and offered the following policy insights. </p>
<p>Successful reform requires institutions as well as institutional capabilities to manage the transition process, and an adequate market size for a competitive market to function. For example, it is unclear whether the individual GCC members’ power markets are large enough to support competitive trading and if they have developed the institutional capabilities to make it work.</p>
<p>The single buyer model market structure is seen as the way to improve the security and reliability of electricity supply. However, this comes with a risk that power producers may over invest in generation capacity because they are receiving state guaranteed returns on capacity additions, thereby creating long-term fiscal liabilities. </p>
<p>Alternatively, a hybrid reform model that, along with an entity buying a major portion of electricity, allows independent power producers (IPPs) to sell electricity directly to end-consumers through bilateral contracts and a spot market can minimize government intervention and thus fiscal risk. But this hybrid reform model has higher implementation costs. </p>
<p>Reforms in the GCC region have several objectives: improving the power sector’s efficiency, attracting new investments and removing fuel subsidies. The reform agenda in the GCC presents new opportunities, such as intra-regional electricity trading among GCC countries. It also offers challenges, including providing incentives to invest in renewables, managing reliable electricity supply and balancing fiscal budgets.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop Series ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-08-29T13:22:33+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:45+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/KS-2017-WB07-Transitioning-to-Liberalized-Energy-Markets_.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2017-08-29;2017-08-29;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

how-to-achieve-economic-prosperity-through-industrial-energy-productivity-improv;;;;Saudi Arabia;EMEA;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;The Economic Impact of Price Controls on Chinaâ€™s Natural Gas Supply Chain;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>KAPSARC and ERI are working together to prepare a joint report comprising of a comparative review of the status of energy productivity and associated policies in Saudi Arabia and China. The review will assess the current status and future plans of industrial development, with a focus on energy efficiency, and discuss the policy practices that might be relevant and valuable for the Kingdom drawing on China’s experiences. This study aims to inform activities and deeper collaboration under China’s One Belt One Road Initiative, which is supported by the Kingdom and aligns with investment priorities as part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>The King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC) and the Energy Research Institute (ERI) of China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) have initiated a joint study into how industrial energy productivity can improve economic prosperity. This study comes at a time of deeper bilateral cooperation under President Xi Jing Ping’s One Belt One Road Initiative and aims to increase understanding of key policies and driving forces around industrial strategy and energy use in Saudi Arabia and China. </p>
<p>Enhancing industrial energy productivity through energy efficiency and diversification has multiple benefits including supporting competitiveness and higher quality jobs while reducing the environmental impact of production. </p>
<p>China has enormous experience capturing these benefits through its system of national energy intensity targets, industrial energy efficiency benchmarks and energy price reform</p>
<p>The Kingdom has set out ambitious plans in its Saudi Vision 2030 to reduce the economy’s reliance on oil through a program of privatization, diversification, renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy price reform among other initiatives.</p>
<p>Greater efforts to share international experiences in energy productivity can play an important role in supporting investment conditions aimed at achieving economic transformation and sustainable development goals. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop Series, Energy efficiency ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-09-27T13:22:32+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:45+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/KS-2018-DP31-The-Economic-Impact-of-Price-Controls-on-Chinaâ€™s-Natural-Gas-Supply-Chain.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2018-05-24;2018-05-24;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;Energy Research Institute;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>Strategies can be developed to mitigate the effects of oil price shocks on the Kingdom’s economy. Oil stabilization funds provide short-run protection against oil revenue fluctuations – in the way that Saudi government deposits and reserves at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) have historically served as a buffer to decouple government budget from oil revenue fluctuations. Sovereign wealth funds create income for future generations to replace revenue streams from depletable resources – one of the purposes of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. We have developed a framework for optimizing policies for adding to and withdrawing from stabilization funds, which we applied to Saudi Arabia as a case study. We will pursue this work by creating an integrated framework for linking stabilization funds with sovereign wealth funds. Recent data show the dependence of the non-oil sector’s growth to the oil price, whereas the non-oil sector growth is key in achieving the Kingdom’s economic diversification objectives. We will study this dependence with a deep dive in data, national accounts and economic theory. </p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>Oil revenue stabilization funds provide short-run protection against oil revenue fluctuations – in the way that Saudi government deposits and reserve at the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) have historically served as a buffer to decouple government budget from oil revenue fluctuations. By contrast, sovereign wealth funds create income for future generations to replace revenue streams from depletable resources – one of the purposes of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. </p>
<p>We developed a framework for optimizing policies for adding to and withdrawing from stabilization funds, which we apply to Saudi Arabia as a case study based on publicly available data. The quantitative results are sensitive to the specific assumptions on the likelihood of particular oil prices arising but the overall results are robust to a wide range of assumptions. </p>
<p>In general, the results match intuition: Withdrawals from the fund occur when oil prices are low and these withdrawals are larger when the fund is larger. However, general intuition is not sufficient to capture the value of optimizing the policies.</p>
<p>In our simulation, assuming that the Saudi government had applied the policies with the benefit of hindsight during the period 2003-2015, we find that the optimization approach can provide the same aggregate economic welfare during the period, but with a reserve fund that is $115 billion larger than the actual outcome at the end of the period.</p>
<p>Looking forward, and assuming random paths for oil prices, the simulated policies lead to fund sizes that fluctuate over time with an average level of $14,512 per capita ($307 billion in total, using the 2015 Saudi population). There is less than a 5 percent probability that the fund exceeds $41,000 per capita ($866 billion in total) and the fund balance falls to zero 16 percent of the time during the simulation period.</p>
<p>By dividing the fund into tranches, we estimate the probability distribution of the first time each tranche would be tapped (i.e., when the lower tranches have been fully used) and show that the higher tranches can be invested in longer duration assets that provide higher returns. This demonstrates why the boundary between a sovereign wealth fund and a stabilization fund is not a bright line.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-10-04T13:22:32+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:44+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KS-2017-DP021-Managing-Oil-Revenue-Stabilization-Funds-A-Framework-for-Developing-Policies.pdf;0;Nader AlKathiri, Tarek Atalla, Frederic Murphy, Axel Pierru;;;;;;;2017-10-04;2017-10-04;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>The Electricity Sector Transition KAPSARC initiative examines the challenges and opportunities of technological innovations in the electricity sector and their impact on policy choices and business models. Like many other countries, Saudi Arabia is undertaking a major electricity sector liberalization which will shape its socio-economic development and crucially affect the government’s wider economic diversification strategy. The Electricity Sector Transition initiative seeks to draw from international experience and discussion to inform and provide practical guidance for policy practitioners and other key stakeholders, as they grapple with the related policy and implementation challenges.</p>

<p>Electricity markets around the world are facing significant challenges from the demand and supply side of the industry. From the supply side, distributed energy resources, usually owned by third parties, are forcing utilities to re-evaluate their business models; while developments in information and communication technologies, such as smart metering and blockchains, are enabling new opportunities for both existing and new players on the demand side.</p>
<p>This confluence of factors is driving a transition from the notion of electricity as a traded commodity to an ingredient of an ecosystem that offers a wide range of flexible services – related to electricity consumption or production – that consumers want and are willing to pay. Three broad themes underline this shift in the electricity value proposition:</p>
<p>Future business models in the power markets will probably not be centered solely on electricity. Consumers may not be interested in products that only save electricity, but rather on products that deliver new services that have the collateral benefit of saving electricity.</p>
<p>Some of these services would be at the intersection between energy, finance and internet access. This would require new forms of regulation, developed in tandem with market offerings rather than constrained by functional silos.</p>
<p>In many cases, the utility will behave as the incubator of new businesses by acting as the operator of last resort. Regulators could allow this to grow, by turning a ‘strategic regulatory blind eye’, until rents captured by newcomers constrain further societal benefits. </p>";KAPSARC Publications;Workshop Series ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-10-05T13:22:31+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:44+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/KS-2018-DP34-Potential-Effects-of-Trade-Liberalization-on-Chinaâ€™s-Imports-of-Plastics-from-the-GCC.pdf;0;;;;;;;;2018-06-04;2018-06-04;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the-political-feasibility-of-policy-options-for-the-uaes-energy-transition;;;;United Arab Emirates;EMEA;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;The Political Feasibility of Policy Options for the UAE’s Energy Transition;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p>This paper – prepared in collaboration with the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, a part of Khalifa University of Science and Technology – applies a model of collective decision-making processes (CDMPs): the KAPSARC Toolkit for Behavioral Analysis (KTAB). KAPSARC has developed KTAB, an open source software platform, to support modeling and analysis of CDMPs. KTAB is intended to be the standard platform for analyzing bargaining problems, generalized voting models and policy decision-making. It is our intent to use KTAB to assemble the building blocks for a broad class of CDMPs. Typical models in KTAB will draw on the insights of subject matter experts regarding decision-makers and influencers in a methodical, consistent manner; and then assist researchers to identify feasible outcomes that are the result of CDMPs.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has said it wishes to transition toward a less carbon-intensive energy system, both as part of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and as one of a number of investments in ‘green’ research and development, technology and power generation. However, given the complexity of the UAE political system, which requires consensus among seven relatively sovereign and independent emirates, as well as commercial and financial interests, it is not immediately clear which policy instruments that might drive the UAE energy transition will prove acceptable and politically plausible. Here, we apply the KAPSARC Toolkit for Behavioral Analysis (KTAB) platform, a model of collective decision-making processes (CDMPs), to assess the political will to agree to and to implement an array of different policy alternatives within the current UAE context. </p>
<p>Energy subsidy reforms in the UAE have already been undertaken, and there appears to be sufficient political will for them to continue, though extensive subsidy reforms appear politically untenable. </p> 
<p>Explicit carbon pricing in the UAE appears politically infeasible, as it does not appear to be able to achieve the consensus required in the face of entrenched interests that would be harmed by such an approach. </p>
<p>There appears to be robust political will to effectively deliver on the UAE’s renewable energy ambitions. An example includes the continuation of the utility scale solar energy tenders that have already proved successful. </p>
<p>Similarly, there appears to be strong and growing support to maintain the UAE’s plans to bring online 5.6GW of nuclear power in the next year, although support for nuclear beyond this level of deployment is uncertain. </p>
<p>Energy efficiency standards, whether targeted toward the commercial or residential sector, appear to be a politically feasible alternative to help lower UAE energy demand. There is moderately strong political will in support of this policy approach. </p>
<p>A perhaps surprising conclusion from this study is the somewhat neutral, although still positive, political will in support of natural gas, given the current dominance of natural gas in the UAE power sector</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper, Subsidies and Transfers;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-10-10T13:22:31+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:44+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KS-2017-DP22-The-Political-Feasibility-of-Policy-Options-for-the-UAEs-Energy-Transition.pdf;0;Brian Efird, Steve Griffiths, Paul Mollet, Imtenan Al-Mubarak, Sgouris Sgouridis, Itsung Tsai;;;;;;;2017-10-10;2017-10-10;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>This study examines potentially efficient global decarbonisation pathways that incorporate mitigation and adaptation to achieve more cost-effective outcomes. It forms part of a joint research program into practical approaches to climate change policy being undertaken by KAPSARC and the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ). This research program aims to help inform the debate around the development of more practical and cost-effective ways to help close the gap between national contributions and agreed global goals in the context of future climate negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>Key Points</strong></p>
<p>This paper presents an analysis of the climate and economic impacts of four different carbon emission scenarios. The scenarios include: a ‘business as usual’ reference scenario; a carbon emission mitigation scenario designed to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting average global temperature increases to no more than 2o Celsius (C) by 2100; and two scenarios that seek to optimize global welfare taking into account the total costs associated with carbon mitigation, adaptation and damage, one with more rapidly declining low-carbon or zero-carbon technology costs after 2050. Key insights include the following:</p>
<p>Under the optimal global welfare case with more rapidly declining technology costs after 2050, global average temperature increases peak at between 2.3oC and 2.7oC, which is above the level achieved under the 2oC by 2100 scenario.</p>
<p>However, the 2o C scenario, which relies exclusively on mitigation responses, requires very high carbon prices to achieve its goals; above $250/ton carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 e) by 2050 and over $1,200/ton CO2 e in 2100 (prices are in real 2014 U.S. dollars). This is reflected in a disproportionately high total economic cost between now and 2100, reaching around 4 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) by 2090.</p>
<p>By comparison, carbon prices associated with the optimal global welfare cases are less than $50/ ton CO2 e by 2050, and between $175/ton CO2 e (standard optimal case) and $300/ton CO2 e (optimal case with more rapidly declining technology costs) in 2100. The total economic costs under the optimal global welfare scenarios never exceed 3 percent of global GDP, with the cost peaking at 2.6 percent of global GDP around 2130 under the optimal scenario, with more rapidly declining technology development costs after 2050.</p>
<p>This analysis suggests that a more pragmatic approach to tackling climate change (referred to as a practical approach hereafter) which balances mitigation, adaptation and damage is likely to minimize the overall cost to society. It also highlights the potential economic benefits associated with accelerating the development and deployment of cost effective low- and zero-carbon technologies.

welfare-implications-of-the-rebound-effect-from-more-energy-efficient-passenger-;;;;World;WORLD;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Welfare Implications of the Rebound Effect From More Energy-Efficient Passenger Cars;<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p><p>KAPSARC’s work on energy demand and efficiency looks at how economic growth, population, energy prices and energy efficiency influence energy demand in different countries, with a focus on Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Cooperation Council. Our objective is to understand and quantify the influence of each of these factors, which also allows us to estimate underlying energy efficiency in different countries. Our work also looks at the welfare implications of policies, from price reform to energy efficiency, and their impact on energy demand.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><p>Improving the energy efficiency of passenger cars makes it cheaper to drive, allowing motorists to take to the roads more frequently. This additional driving, which offsets some of the expected energy savings from energy efficiency, is known as the rebound effect and is perceived negatively. This paper undertakes a cost-benefit analysis of the rebound effect following an energy efficiency improvement in passenger cars for 100 countries. We find that:</p><p>The rebound effect in passenger cars is welfare reducing in most cases, especially in countries that had some combination of low gasoline prices, high congestion and high accident costs.</p><p>Energy efficiency policies may be less likely to deliver net benefits because of welfare reducing rebound. Furthermore, in countries with the most welfare reducing rebound effects, even a free (that is, zero cost) energy efficiency improvement in passenger cars can become welfare reducing. It is therefore important to model rebound, as it can affect decisions to rollout energy efficiency policies</p><p>Energy efficiency policies such as fuel economy standards may find greater success when fuel prices are higher, and therefore may be more effective when combined with policies that raise energy prices. Additionally, complementary policies that can mitigate congestion and reduce road accidents will also indirectly improve the net benefits of energy efficiency policies for passenger cars.</p><p>There may be a need to change the negative perceptions that the rebound effect holds in energy policy discussions. For energy efficiency improvements in other areas such as building lighting or air conditioning, the rebound effect will probably be welfare enhancing due to the absence of externalities such as congestion and accidents.</p>;KAPSARC Publications;Discussion paper ;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-10-30T13:22:30+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:43+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KS-2017-DP23-Welfare-Implications-of-the-Rebound-Effect-From-More-Energy-Efficient-Passenger-Cars.pdf;0;Ziyad Alfawzan, Anwar Gasim;;;;;;;2017-10-30;2017-10-30;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<p>The objective of this project is to assess potential economic and technical gains that could be realized by utilizing the GCC Interconnector to deliver electricity at least-cost across the GCC.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This paper presents datasets that support economic and policy analyses of countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The objective is to provide an overview of the GCC energy systems and serve as a reference for researchers performing quantitative modeling and analysis. The following data have been collected from public sources, using the most recent complete datasets available. </p>
<p>We begin by describing the GCC in terms of electricity systems specific to each country. For each system, we compile and present information about how electricity and water are supplied in terms of technologies and fuels. A key point is the linkage of electricity and water production in the GCC. Power plants typically produce a combination of electricity and water, primarily through desalinating seawater using waste heat. This linkage must be considered when analyzing how energy is transformed in the GCC. </p>
<p>An assessment of fossil and renewable resources follows in the third section. The GCC states are well endowed with fossil and renewable resources. To date, fossil energy has been exploited for export and domestic consumption while the use of renewable resources has been negligible in terms of total primary energy supply. </p>
<p>The fourth section presents government administered fuel prices and electricity tariffs. These provide a context for understanding the composition of the energy and water sectors. Regulated energy prices are a characteristic of the GCC. Administered prices on the supply (electricity production) and demand side (electricity consumption) have been, and continue to be, a key barrier to electricity trade and greater penetration of renewable technologies in the power and water sectors. Ongoing price reforms are expected to improve the prospects of electricity trade and cost-effectiveness of renewables. </p>
<p>Existing energy policies, future targets and power sector reforms are covered in the fifth section. GCC countries have announced plans to both diversify electricity production (by deploying renewables and nuclear capacity) and to reduce demand (through efficiency measures). Recently announced targets in all six GCC states suggest that renewable resources and nuclear energy will be a prominent component of the region’s future energy systems. Almost 80 GW of renewables will be installed, around four times the amount of nuclear power that is planned in the region. </p>
<p>The accompanying datasets are available on the OpenKAPSARC data portal and will be updated as new data are available.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Methodology papers;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-11-01T13:22:29+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:43+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KS-2018-DP37-Policy-Lessons-From-Chinas-CCS-Experience.pdf;0;David Wogan, Shreekar Pradhan, Shahad Albardi;;;;;;;2018-07-02;2018-07-02;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
electricity-transmission-formulations-in-multi-sector-national-planning-models;;;;Saudi Arabia;EMEA;http://www.kapsarc.org/terms-conditions/;Public;;;;;;Electricity Market Integration in the GCC and MENA…;"<p><strong>About the Project</strong></p>
<p> We developed the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM) for Saudi Arabia to understand the dynamics of the country’s energy system. It is a partial equilibrium model formulated as a mixed complementarity problem to capture the administered prices that permeate the local economy. KEM has been previously used to study the impacts of various industrial fuel pricing policies, improved residential energy efficiency on the energy economy, the feasibility of installing coalfired power plants in Saudi Arabia, and reforming residential electricity tariffs. In the present paper, we use it to assess the effects of introducing an optimal power flow formulation for electricity transmission on policy-relevant metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to assess policy-relevant effects of incorporating a more proper representation of electricity transmission in multi-sector national policy models. This goal is achieved by employing the KAPSARC Energy Model (KEM), which is the first publicly available large-scale energy policy model for Saudi Arabia. Past studies using KEM have examined industrial pricing policy, residential energy efficiency, the prospects of power generation technologies and residential electricity pricing. These studies have shown that under certain fuel pricing scenarios, significant renewable energy capacity is deployed.</p>
<p>Previous versions of KEM used a transshipment formulation for electricity transfer, which basically treats it similar to fuel transport. Electricity transmission formulations, however, represent the physical constraints that govern power flows in reallife. The variability and intermittency of renewable power imposes limitations on the operations of the grid and models that do not incorporate a representation of electricity transmission may miss key insights, particularly when large-scale deployment of renewable technologies is contemplated. This study illustrates the methodology and consequences of moving from a transshipment formulation of KEM to one which includes transmission with a single or multiple nodes within each region. </p>

<p>Our results show: </p>
<p>The optimal investment in photovoltaics (PV) and the marginal costs of delivering electricity change considerably when transmission of electricity both within regions and between regions is incorporated into the model compared to the simple transshipment formulation.</p>
<p>The number of nodes in each region described by the model alters the model outcomes more than whether the model incorporates transmission losses or not. However, a version of KEM with a single node in each region for transmission and without accounting for transmission losses still provides valuable insight compared with the transshipment formulation, while keeping the model size tractable</p>
<p>Introducing transmission into the model gives results that are more affected by the operations of the power system than by the fuel and technology mix. The market-clearing price of natural gas in a deregulated environment only changes slightly because reduced PV deployment (compared to the transshipment version) is mostly offset by a minor increase in dispatch of gas-fired generation.</p>
<p>In a regulatory model where location marginal prices are passed on to consumers, the new model captures the changes in the marginal costs of electricity delivery at the transmission nodes whereas the simpler transshipment formulation would miss this insight. In other words, the transmission component is needed for planning a system where location marginal prices are passed on to consumers.</p>";KAPSARC Publications;Methodology papers, KEM;Open Database License (ODbL);en;;2017-11-05T13:22:28+00:00;;;;2018-11-21T07:02:42+00:00;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;https://www.kapsarc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KS-2018-WB19-Electricity-Market-Integration-in-the-GCC-and-MENA-Imperatives-and-Challenges.pdf;0;Walid Matar, Amro Elshurafa;;;;;;;2018-07-26;2018-07-26;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies And Research Center;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
